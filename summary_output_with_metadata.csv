*   Risks and opportunities were prioritized based on likelihood and financial impact, resulting in a combined risk register. The threshold for financial materiality is outlined on page 130 within the Independent Auditors’ Report.
*   The overall climate risk exposure for Volex is low, and the group is financially resilient and strategically robust to climate change.
*   Any impacts on assets are limited and risks can be accommodated within business-as-usual activity considering existing and planned mitigation strategies.
*   There are no effects of climate-related matters reflected in judgements and estimates applied in the financial statements as a result.
*   Volex used the Munich Re Location Risk Intelligence Tool to assess current and potential future physical climate-related risks at all 28 operational locations, including floods, storms, sea level rises, drought, wildfires and precipitation stress.
*   Three climate scenarios were selected based on IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathways ('RCP') mapped to the latest IPCC AR6 report’s Shared Social Economic Pathways (‘SSPs).
    *   Net Zero 2050 Scenario RCP 2.6/IPCC SSP1: c1.5°C temperature rise by the end of the century.
    *   ‘Middle of the Road’ RCP 4.5/IPCC SSP2: 2-3°C temperature rise by the end of the century.
    *   ‘Hothouse world’ RCP 8.5/IPCC SSP5: >4°C temperature rise by the end of the century.
*   Two potentially significant climate-related physical risks have been identified based on the likelihood of an event, the materiality of the location, and the potential financial impact.
*   The limitations and assumptions of scenario analysis includes: Scenarios may only provide high-level global and regional forecasts; Not all risks are easily subject to scenario analysis; Scenario analysis requires analysis of specific factors and modelling them with fixed assumptions; Impacts are to be considered in the context of the current financial performance and prices; Gross impacts are assumed to occur without the company responding with any mitigating actions, which may reduce the impact of risks; Impacts are modelled to occur in a linear fashion when, in practice, dramatic climate-related impacts may occur suddenly after tipping points are breached; and The analysis considers each risk and scenario in isolation, when in practice climate-related risks may occur in parallel as part of a wider set of potential global impacts."

*   **Climate scenario time horizons:**
    *   **Net Zero 2050 (NZE):** An ambitious scenario for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO emissions by 2050, meeting the TCFD requirement of using a ""below 2°C"" scenario.
    *   **Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS):** A scenario representing the roll forward of already announced policy measures, with temperatures rising by around 2.5°C by 2100 from pre-industrial levels, with a 50% probability.

*   **Time Horizons:**
    *   **Short (2024-2025):** Aligned with short-term decarbonisation pathways used by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).
    *   **Medium (2026-2035):** Aligned to the Group’s net zero by 2035 target (scope 1 and 2).
    *   **Long (2036-2050):** Aligned to the Group’s net zero by 2050 target (scope 1, 2 and 3).

*   **Risk: Carbon price in own operations**
    *   **TCFD category:** Policy & Legal
    *   **Risk description:** The scope of carbon pricing is expected to expand and the price of carbon is expected to rise. IEA forecasts that carbon prices relevant to Volex under NZE and STEPS scenarios are projected to increase.
    *   **Area:** Own operations
    *   **Potential financial impact:**
        *   Price of carbon related to GHG emissions in own operations.
        *   Increased operational expenses (greatest impact on the energy intensive cable manufacturing sites).
        *   Increasing regulations on existing products increases costs and exposes the business to litigation.
        *   Greater costs associated with emissions reduction activities.

*   **Risk: Carbon price in value chain**
    *   **TCFD category:** Policy & Legal
    *   **Risk description:** Volex is exposed to potential carbon pricing impacts in the value chain. It is uncertain how and when carbon prices will be imposed and how much will be passed on to Volex.
    *   **Area:** Upstream and downstream
    *   **Potential financial impact:**
        *   Higher costs of purchased goods and services as suppliers pass on costs.
        *   Higher costs associated with carbon tax on scope 3 emissions.

*   **Risk: Failure to meet/maintain expected ESG credentials**
    *   **TCFD category:** Reputation
    *   **Risk description:** Volex has obligations to maintain and show progress against sustainability ratings and to demonstrate progress on decarbonisation.
    *   **Area:** Own operations
    *   **Potential financial impact:**
        *   Increased shareholder concern could lead to increased cost of capital and loss of investment.
        *   Failure to maintain customer expectations on sustainability performance could lead to loss of trust, competitive advantage and ultimately contracts.
