The Committee is also given regular updates and, as required, takes key decisions on Group-wide\nremuneration plans. It takes changes in workforce remuneration into account when making decisions on executive remuneration.",
        "All-employee approach to remuneration\nThe Committee developed the current Remuneration Policy, agreed by shareholders in 2022, having reviewed the wider remuneration\nframework across the organisation and the way that this drives alignment of individuals towards organisational goals. It receives\nupdates annually on any material changes to wider workforce arrangements and additionally considers employee feedback on\nremuneration matters. This is from Group-wide mechanisms (such as our Your Voice survey) but additionally from direct interaction\nbetween designated Non-Executive Directors and employees.\nOur remuneration principles apply to all employees and are designed to ensure we can attract, motivate and retain people\nfundamental to achieving our vision, and be part of a global organisation. We want employees engaged and delivering because they\nare excited by our vision, the part they can play in this, and the difference they can make.\nThese principles are applied as consistently as we can, such that remuneration is standardised wherever possible, and delivered in line\nwith our values. While the quantum may vary between roles, the principle of aligning reward outcomes with performance is fundamental\nto the way we operate.\nRemuneration element Our approach\nBase salary Pay rates are determined with reference to the skill set and experience of the individual. All\npay rates are reviewed annually across the Group, with adjustments with reference to\nindividual performance levels, market pay competitiveness and overall business affordability.\nBenefits The countries we operate in display different practices in terms of benefit provision. Typical\nbenefits include access to life insurance, pension or retirement provision and may include\nmedical cover.

The 2024 calculation is based on the remuneration of the new CEO,\nJorgen Kokke. There are a number of factors which impact the ratio. Jorgen\u2019s USD-denominated salary is higher relative to the former\nCEO, once converted into sterling using a prevailing rate. Although Jorgen did not have any performance share plan awards vesting",
        "during the year (in contrast to the prior year when the former CEO had some PSP awards which vested), his 2024 bonus was higher than\nthe former CEO in 2023, reflecting stronger relative Company performance in 2024.\nIn the pay ratio table above, we detail the potential ratio based on the CEO\u2019s target remuneration, as set out under the remuneration\npolicy. It is important to note that a high proportion of the CEO remuneration is based on performance against the short- and long-term\nincentive plans, and that payouts can significantly change year-on-year, significantly affecting the ratio going forward. This is the\nprimary reason why the pay ratio has varied since 2018, both above and below the potential ratio based on the CEO\u2019s target\nremuneration. However, in the last three years, the actual median pay ratio has been in a range of 32:1 to 41:1, in each case below the\nnotional ratio based on the CEO\u2019s target remuneration.\nThe Committee is satisfied that the individuals identified within each relevant percentile appropriately reflect the employee pay profiles\nat those quartiles and that the overall picture presented by the ratios is consistent with our approach to colleague remuneration.

        "Newly identified\nSimilar level of risk\nMateriality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was \u00a32.5 million which was determined\non the basis of 5% of forecast profit before tax excluding the impact of exceptional items and the net IAS\n41 valuation movement on biological assets. Our determined materiality equates to 7% of this measure\nat year end.\nScoping We performed detailed audit procedures over 13 components of the group. Of these, 8 were subject to a\nfull scope audit, and 5 were subject to specified procedures. Our full-scope and specified procedures\ntesting achieved coverage of 77% of Group revenue, 88% of Group net assets, and 88% of Group profit\nbefore tax, excluding the impact of exceptional items and the net IAS 41 valuation movement on\nbiological assets.\nSignificant changes in We have identified a new key audit matter this year, being the carrying value of ABS goodwill. This\nour approach change has been driven by performance in the ABS segment (Note 5) and the resultant reduced\nheadroom on goodwill leading to increased sensitivity of management\u2019s models to key judgements and\nestimates.**108\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nIndependent Auditor\u2019s Report continued\nTo the members of Genus plc\n4.

        "challenging these assumptions through comparison with our own understanding of the business, external information, and evidence\ngathered over the course of our audit, including:\n\u2013 Reading analyst reports, industry data and other external information and inspecting them for both corroborative and\ncontradictory evidence in relation to these assumptions;\n\u2013 Challenging forecasted profit and cashflows by comparison to recent historical financial information;\n\u2013 Challenging the key underlying data used in forecast scenarios by assessing it for consistency with our understanding of the\nbusiness model and risks; and\n\u2013 Evaluating the accuracy of current and forecast covenant calculations and performing additional analysis to determine the level of\nsensitivity in forecast headroom in relation to cash and covenants.\n\u2022 Assessing the mechanical accuracy of the Group\u2019s models;\n\u2022 Reviewing the terms of the Group\u2019s financing arrangements as at the balance sheet date, comprising a \u00a3190m multi-currency RCF,\na US$170m RCF and a partially utilised accordian arrangement; reperforming debt covenant computations over the going concern\nperiod; and evaluating the associated disclosures;\n\u2022 Reviewing the terms of the extension of those facilities described above, and disclosed as a non-adjusting post balance sheet event\nin Note 27; and\n\u2022 Evaluating the Group\u2019s disclosures against the requirements of IAS 1 \u2018Presentation of Financial Statements\u2019.\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,\nindividually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group\u2019s and parent company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for a\nperiod of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\nIn relation to the reporting on how the group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw",

Key audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial\nstatements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud)\nthat we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources\nin the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,\nand we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n5.1. Valuation of Biological Assets under IAS 41 \u2018Agriculture\u2019\nKey audit matter The Group carries biological assets at fair value in line with the requirements of IAS 41 \u2018Agriculture\u2019. Discounted\ndescription cash flow analyses are performed in determining the valuation. As at 30 June 2024, the Group held total\nbiological assets (excluding those recognised in inventory) of \u00a3329.7m (2023: \u00a3342.0m).\nCertain of the assumptions included within the valuation models are subject to estimation uncertainty, and\naccordingly, require the exercise of a significant degree of judgement. In planning our audit, we identified the\nfollowing assumptions as being the most significant in the determination of the valuation of each species:\nBovine: the growth rates over the forecast period of proven and genomic semen sales, and the discount rate\napplied to the forecast cash flows in respect of the Bovine herd.",
        "Porcine: the discount rates applied to the forecast cash flows in respect of the Pureline herds.\nDetails of the key sources of estimation uncertainty identified, the Group\u2019s accounting policy, and the\nbiological assets held are disclosed in notes 4 and 16 to the financial statements.

        "Key observations We are satisfied that the valuation of biological assets and the related disclosures are appropriate.\n5.2. Carrying value of ABS goodwill\nKey audit matter As at 30 June 2024 the Group recognised goodwill of \u00a3110.3m (2023: \u00a3107.8m) with \u00a330.8m (2023: \u00a331.6m)\ndescription attributed to the ABS cash generating unit (\u201cCGU\u201d). Details of the make-up of the goodwill balance are\npresented in Note 14 to the financial statements.\nConsistent with previous years, the group has reached the conclusion that there is no impairment to recognise\nin ABS goodwill. This is based on management\u2019s discounted cash flow model determining a value in use to be\ncompare with the carrying amount of the CGU. Profitability in the year and a reassessment of forecasts for the\nABS business has reduced headroom in the impairment calculation from \u00a3191.7m in 2023 to \u00a376.3m as at the\nbalance sheet date. Accordingly, the conclusion is more sensitive to changes in key assumptions. Sensitivities\nto key assumptions are also presented in Note 14.\nOur key audit matter is focused on the weighted average short-term profit growth rates in the ABS forecasts\n(referred to as \u2018CAGR\u2019 in Note 14), and particularly the forecast growth in profitability from the achieved 2024\nresults to the forecast 2025 results.\nHow the scope of our In responding to the identified key audit matter, we completed the following audit procedures:\naudit responded to the \u2022 Reviewed management\u2019s documentation and considered the appropriateness of the \u2018value in use\u2019\nkey audit matter methodology;\n\u2022 Assessed the mechanical accuracy of the calculations;\n\u2022 With the support of our valuation specialists, challenged the appropriateness of the discount rates applied\nto future cash flows;\n\u2022 Challenged management\u2019s forecasts for ABS short-term profit growth rates in FY25, and separately for FY26\n\u2013 FY29, through assessing management\u2019s expectations of changes in selling prices and product mix, and",

Our application of materiality\n6.1. Materiality\nWe define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions\nof a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit\nwork and in evaluating the results of our work.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\nGroup financial statements Parent company financial statements\nMateriality \u00a32.5m (2023: \u00a33.2m) \u00a32.3m (2023: \u00a32.6m)\nBasis for determining materiality We determined materiality on the basis of 1% (2023: 1%) of Net Assets and capped at\n5% (2023: 5%) of forecast profit before tax 90% of materiality for the Group financial\nexcluding exceptional items (as defined in statements.\nnote 7) and changes in net IAS 41 valuation\nmovement on biological assets (as\nexplained in note 16). Our determined\nmateriality equates to 7% (2023: 5.4%) of this\nmeasure at year end.**110\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nIndependent Auditor\u2019s Report continued\nTo the members of Genus plc\nGroup financial statements Parent company financial statements\nRationale for the benchmark applied We determined profit before tax excluding Net Assets were selected as an appropriate\nexceptional items and changes in net IAS benchmark for determining materiality, as\n41 valuation movement in biological assets the Parent Company acts primarily as a",
        "as an appropriate benchmark for holding company.\ndetermining materiality so as to avoid\ndistortion that could otherwise arise from\nnon-recurring or highly volatile items\nincluding exceptional items and the IAS 41\nfair value movements.\n6.2. Performance materiality\nWe set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and\nundetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole.\nGroup financial statements Parent company financial statements\nPerformance materiality 70% (2023: 70%) of Group materiality 70% (2023: 70%) of parent company\nmateriality\nBasis and rationale for determining In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors:\nperformance materiality \u2022 Our cumulative knowledge of the Group and its control environment;\n\u2022 The low turnover in key management personnel;\n\u2022 The high degree of centralisation in the Group\u2019s financial reporting controls and\nprocesses; and\n\u2022 The low number and value of corrected and uncorrected misstatements identified in\nprior periods.\nWe agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of \u00a3125k (2023:\n\u00a3160k), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the\nCommittee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n7. An overview of the scope of our audit\n7.1. Identification and scoping of components\nOur audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing\nthe risks of material misstatement at the Group level.\nThe Group operates globally with PIC and ABS segments operating under different reporting lines in each country, and aggregated into",
        "regions. We determined that each segment within a country represents a component to our audit; for example ABS in the United\nKingdom is an audit component.\nComponents were selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement\nidentified. Based on that assessment, we identified 13 components of interest for the purposes of the group audit (2023: 13). Of these\ncomponents, 8 were designated as subject to full scope audit procedures (2023: 8), with the remaining 5 subject to specified procedures\n(2023: 5). Excluding the Parent Company, our component audits were performed using materiality between \u00a30.8m and \u00a31.1m (2023: \u00a31.1m\nand \u00a31.3m). These components represent the principal business units and account for 77% of the Group\u2019s revenue (2023: 76%), 88% of the\nGroup\u2019s net assets (2023: 87%) and 88% of the Group\u2019s profit before tax, excluding the impact of exceptional items and the net IAS 41\nvaluation movement on biological assets (2023: 86%).\nAt the Group level, we evaluated the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there\nwere no significant risks of material misstatement within the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject\nto full scope audit or specified procedures.\nREVENUE PROFIT BEFORE TAX NET ASSETS\n3 3\n3\n2 2\n2\n1\n1 1\n1 Full audit scope 64% 1 Full audit scope 79% 1 Full audit scope 78%\n2 Specified audit procedures 13% 2 Specified audit procedures 9% 2 Specified audit procedures 10%\n3 Review at Group level 23% 3 Review at Group level 12% 3 Review at Group level 12%**111\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nSTNEMETATS\nLAICNANIF\n7.2. Our consideration of the control environment\nThe Group has been progressing through a programme of global ERP migration, with the majority of the worldwide operations now\noperating on \u2018GenusOne\u2019, a Microsoft Dynamic 365 technology. With the involvement of our IT specialists, we have maintained our scope",
        "of IT procedures in the current year and have assessed the transition processes, and obtained an understanding of general IT controls\noperating within the Microsoft Dynamics 365 platform. We have not placed reliance on any controls and our audit procedures (centrally\nand at components) are substantive in nature.\nFor all components we obtained an understanding of the relevant controls associated with the financial reporting process, areas of\nsignificant audit risk, and significant accounting estimates.\n7.3. Our consideration of climate-related risks\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of climate change on the Group\u2019s business and its financial statements.\nAs discussed on page 48, the Group has assessed the risks and opportunities associated with various future climate-related scenarios\nand its own commitment to transition to an operating model that has a reduced level of GHG emissions. As a part of our audit\nprocedures, we have obtained management\u2019s climate-related risk assessment and held discussions with those charged with\ngovernance to understand the process of identifying climate-related risks, the determination of mitigating actions and the impact on\nthe Group\u2019s financial statements.\nWe have considered the Group\u2019s assessment of the impact of these risks and opportunities on the financial statements and their\nconclusion that there is no material impact on the Group\u2019s carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. We have\nalso evaluated the appropriateness of disclosures included in the financial statements in note 3, and have read the climate related\ndisclosures in the Sustainability report to consider whether they are materially consistent with the financial statements and our\nknowledge obtained in the audit.\n7.4. Working with other auditors\nWhere appropriate, the group audit team engaged component audit teams to perform the audit procedures as set out in section 7.1.",
        "We engaged component audit teams in the UK, US, China, Brazil and Mexico; the group audit team performed specified audit\nprocedures directly on components in Chile, Canada, and Spain.\nThe group audit team held regular communication with the component auditors in planning for, and throughout, the year end audit\nprocess. Oversight of the component auditors included attending internal planning and status meetings, attending close meetings held\nwith local management, and reviewing relevant audit documentation. We visited the UK (ABS and PIC), US (ABS and PIC) and China (PIC)\ncomponent teams, held in-person discussions and reviewed on site. For the rest of the components, our oversight utilised our remote\ncollaboration tools and we enhanced this oversight through a number of measures (as appropriate to each component), including\naccessing and directly reviewing their audit files, more frequent dialogue and use of video conferencing and screen-sharing facilities.\n8. Other information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor\u2019s\nreport thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our\nreport, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with\nthe financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a\nmaterial misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a",
        "material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n9. Responsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors\u2019 responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial\nstatements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is\nnecessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group\u2019s and the parent company\u2019s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of\naccounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic\nalternative but to do so.\n10. Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high\nlevel of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,\nthey could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC\u2019s website at:\nwww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our\nresponsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our\nprocedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n11.1. Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and\nregulations, we considered the following:\n\u2022 the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the group\u2019s remuneration\npolicies, key drivers for directors\u2019 remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;\n\u2022 the group\u2019s own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error as approved by the Board;\n\u2022 results of our enquiries of management, internal audit, the directors and the Audit and Risk committee about their own identification\nand assessment of the risks of irregularities, including those that are specific to the group\u2019s sector;\n\u2022 any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the group\u2019s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:\n\u2013 identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance,\nincluding in relation to Russian Sanctions (described in the Audit and Risk Committee report on page 76 and in note 4 to the\nfinancial statements, and defined in the Glossary on page 200;\n\u2013 detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;",
        "\u2013 the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;\n\u2022 the matters discussed among the audit engagement team including significant component audit teams and relevant internal\nspecialists, including tax, valuations, pensions, ESG, and IT specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial\nstatements and any potential indicators of fraud.\nAs a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and\nidentified the greatest potential for fraud in the area of unusual adjustments to revenue. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we\nare also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.\nWe also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of those\nlaws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The\nkey laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, pensions legislation, and global\ntax legislation.\nIn addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but\ncompliance with which may be fundamental to the group\u2019s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the group\u2019s\ncompliance with health and safety regulations, environmental regulations, and the Russian Sanctions.\n11.2. Audit response to risks identified\nAs a result of performing the above, we did not identify any key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud or non-compliance\nwith laws and regulations.\nOur procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:\n\u2022 reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of",
        "relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;\n\u2022 enquiring of management, the Audit and Risk Committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and\nclaims;\n\u2022 performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement\ndue to fraud;\n\u2022 reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports, and reviewing relevant\ncorrespondence with HMRC;\n\u2022 in addressing the risk of non-compliance with the Russian Sanctions, enquiring of internal legal counsel and evaluating\ncorrespondence with external legal counsel, and reviewing relevant licences and documentation;\n\u2022 in addressing the risk of fraud through unusual adjustments to revenue, leveraging bespoke analytics to identify revenue entries with\ncharacteristics that appeared unusual, and testing the appropriateness of these entries by tracing to supporting documentation and\nevaluating the business rationale; and\n\u2022 in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other\nadjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and\nevaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including\ninternal specialists and significant component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws\nand regulations throughout the audit.\nREPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n12.

REPORTING ENTITY\nGenus plc (the \u2018Company\u2019) is a public company limited by shares and incorporated in England, United Kingdom under the Companies\nAct 2006. Its company number is 02972325 and its registered office is Matrix House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4DZ.\nThe Group Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as\nthe \u2018Group\u2019). We have used the equity method to account for the Group\u2019s interests in joint ventures and associates. Our business model\non pages 8 to 9 explains the Group\u2019s operations and principal activities.\n2. BASIS OF PREPARATION\nWe have prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the\nrequirements of the Companies Act 2006. The Group Financial Statements have also been prepared in accordance with International\nFinancial Reporting Standards (\u2018IFRS\u2019) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\u2018IASB\u2019).\nUnless otherwise stated, we have consistently applied the material accounting policy information set out below to all periods presented\nin these Group Financial Statements.\nThe going concern statement has been included in the Strategic Report on page 56 and forms part of these statements.\nFunctional and presentational currency\nWe present the Group Financial Statements in Sterling, which is the Company\u2019s functional and presentational currency. All financial",
        "information presented in Sterling has been rounded to the nearest \u00a30.1m.\nUse of estimates\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect our application\nof accounting policies and our reported assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe review our estimates and underlying assumptions on an ongoing basis, and recognise revisions to accounting estimates in the\nperiod in which we revise the estimate and in any future periods affected.\nNote 4 provides information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and the critical judgements we made in applying\naccounting policies that have the most effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.\nAlternative Performance Measures (\u2018APMs\u2019)\nIn reporting financial information, the Group presents APMs, which are not defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS and\nwhich are not considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures.\nThe Group believes that these APMs provide stakeholders with additional helpful information on the performance of the business.\nThe APMs are consistent with how we plan our business performance and report on it in our internal management reporting to the\nBoard and GELT. Some of these measures are also used for the purpose of setting remuneration targets.\nFor a full list of all APMs please see the Alternative Performance Measures Glossary section of the Annual Report on pages 192 to 199.\nChange of reportable segments\nDuring the year, management determined that product development revenues, costs and attributable assets and liabilities are more\naccurately presented as part of each trading unit\u2019s profit and loss account. This adjustment aligns our external reporting with our\ninternal reporting structure, reflecting how the performance of the trading units is assessed and managed. As a result, the prior period",

        "Accounting convention\nWe prepare the Group Financial Statements under the historical cost convention, except for our biological assets, share-based\npayment expense, pension liabilities and derivative financial instruments. In accordance with IFRS, we measure biological assets at fair\nvalue less point-of-sale costs, which represent distribution costs and selling expenses, and share-based payment expense, pension\nliabilities, and certain financial instruments at fair value.**122\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements continued\nFor the year ended 30 June 2024\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION APPLIED IN THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD THAT RELATES TO THE FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS AS A WHOLE CONTINUED\nBasis of consolidation\nSubsidiaries are entities the Group controls. We have control of an entity when we are exposed, or have the rights, to variable returns\nfrom the entity and have the ability to affect the returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, we take into account\npotential voting rights that we can currently exercise or convert. We fully consolidate the results of subsidiaries we acquire from the date\nthat control transfers to the Group. We cease consolidating the results of subsidiaries that we cease to control from the date that\ncontrol passes.\nIn preparing the Group Financial Statements, we eliminate intra-Group balances and any unrealised income and expenses arising from\nintra-Group transactions. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the\ninvestment, to the extent of our interest in the investee. We eliminate unrealised losses in the same way as unrealised gains, but only\nto the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\nForeign currencies\nWe record foreign currency transactions in the relevant Group entity\u2019s functional currency, at the exchange rate on the transaction date.",
        "At each balance sheet date, we retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate on\nthe balance sheet date. We recognise the foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation in the Group Income Statement.\nWhen non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency, we translate them at the exchange rate\nat the transaction date. When non-monetary assets and liabilities are stated at fair value in a foreign currency, we translate them at the\nprevailing exchange rate on the date we determined the fair value. We recognise the foreign exchange differences arising on\nretranslation in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling at the prevailing\nexchange rates at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange differences are booked into foreign currency translation reserves\nand reported in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income. We translate these operations\u2019 revenues and expenses using an\naverage rate for the period.\nWhen exchange differences arise from the fair value movement of related effective hedges, we take them to the foreign currency\ntranslation reserve. When we dispose of a foreign operation, we release these differences to the Income Statement. Exchange\nmovements on inter-company loans considered to be permanent equity are recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive\nIncome, together with any related taxation.\nThe principal exchange rates were as follows:\nAverage Closing\n2024 2023 2022 2024 2023 2022\nUS Dollar/\u00a3 1.26 1.21 1.32 1.27 1.27 1.22\nEuro/\u00a3 1.17 1.15 1.18 1.18 1.16 1.16\nBrazilian Real/\u00a3 6.35 6.20 6.94 7.07 6.08 6.39\nMexican Peso/\u00a3 21.69 22.84 26.97 23.12 21.74 24.45\nChinese Yuan/\u00a3 9.06 8.44 8.55 9.19 9.21 8.15\nRussian Rouble/\u00a3 115.46 86.29 98.75 108.18 112.79 66.73\nResearch and development",

We do\nnot capitalise development expenditure separately for these herds, as their fair value is included in the fair value of the Group\u2019s\nbiological assets, in accordance with IAS 41.\nWe disclose the costs of research and development activities, as required by IAS 38 (see note 8).\nOther income and deferred income\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2019, the Company entered into a strategic collaboration with Beijing Capital Agribusiness (\u2018BCA\u2019) under\nwhich BCA will establish and fund a collaboration-specific entity (\u2018BCA Future Bio-Tech\u2019) which will use Genus\u2019s intellectual property and\nknow-how to pursue the PRRS-resistance regulatory and development work in China. Genus will receive consideration after meeting\ncertain milestones in the development programme.\nEach milestone is considered to be either a separate performance obligation, or a set of separate performance obligations, under this\nagreement and milestones are unbundled in the contractual arrangement as if they are distinct from one another.\nWe assess each separate performance obligation relating to the milestone payments, and upon completion of those performance\nobligations recognise the fair value of amounts earned in other income. Some performance obligations, such as the transfer\nof know-how, are recognised at a point in time whereas others, such as the provision of technical services, are recognised over time.",

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION APPLIED IN THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD THAT RELATES TO THE FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS AS A WHOLE CONTINUED\nReversals of impairment\nWe reverse an impairment loss in respect of assets other than goodwill when the impairment loss may no longer exist and we have\nchanged the estimates we used to determine the recoverable amount.\nWe only reverse an impairment loss to the extent that the asset\u2019s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount it would have\nhad, net of depreciation or amortisation, if we had not recognised the impairment loss.\nClimate change\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements we have considered the impact of both physical and transition climate change\nrisks on the current valuation of our assets and liabilities. We do not believe that there is a material impact on the financial reporting\njudgements and estimates arising from our considerations and as a result the valuations of our assets or liabilities have not been\nsignificantly impacted by these risks as at 30 June 2024. In concluding, we specifically considered the impact of climate change on the\ngrowth rates and projected cash flows as part of our goodwill impairment testing (see note 14). As government policies evolve as a result\nof commitments to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, we will continue to monitor implications on the valuations of our assets and liabilities\nthat could arise in future years.\nNew standards and interpretations\nIn the current period, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\nthat are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins after 1 January 2023 and have been implemented with effect from\n1 July 2023. These are:",

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the\napplication of policies and reported amounts.\nCritical judgements represent key decisions made by management in the application of the Group\u2019s accounting policies, where a",
        "significant risk of materially different outcomes exists due to management assumptions or sources of estimation uncertainty. Estimates\nand judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future\nevents that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the\nnext 12 months are discussed below.\nCritical accounting judgements\nAdjusting items\nThe Directors believe that the adjusted profit and earnings per share measures provide additional information to shareholders on the\nperformance of the business. These measures are consistent with how business performance is measured internally by the Board\nand GELT. Further descriptions and reconciliations are provided in the APM glossary.\nThe profit before tax and adjusting items measures are not recognised profit measures under IFRS and may not be directly comparable\nwith adjusted profit measures used by other companies. The classification of adjusting items requires significant judgement, after\nconsidering the nature and intentions of a transaction. The Group\u2019s definitions of adjusting items are outlined within the Group\naccounting policies and have been applied consistently year-on-year.\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\nDetermination of the fair value of biological assets including those held in equity-accounted investees (note 16 and note 18)\nDetermining the fair values of our bovine and porcine biological assets requires the application of a number of estimates and assumptions.\nBelow is a list of these estimates and assumptions, showing whether we consider them to be observable or unobservable inputs to the\nfair value determination. In addition, we identify those inputs that are \u2018readily obtainable\u2019 transactional data or \u2018open market prices\u2019.",

        "present value.\nImpact of Russian sanctions\nThe Group has two group operating companies that are incorporated in Russia \u2013 Limited Liability Co. Genus ABS Russia and PIC\nGenetics LLC (\u2018Russian-based subsidiaries/entities\u2019). Following the sanctions that have been put in place by the UK and other\ngovernments, the Group implemented a comprehensive screening process with external counsel to ensure that its Russian entities do\nnot trade with sanctioned individuals or entities controlled by them. The main impact of the sanctions regime on our business has been\nto categorise the banks in Russia into sanctioned and non-sanctioned banks. Where we receive money from sanctioned banks we are\nunable to use the cash without a licence from His Majesty\u2019s Treasury (\u2018HMT\u2019). For cash receipts from non-sanctioned banks into the\nentities\u2019 non-sanctioned banks we are able to use the cash in Russia for day-to-day operations.\nThe Group applied to HMT for a licence on 25 April 2022: to allow the use of payments from sanctioned banks by non-sanctioned\nRussian customers for the delivery of porcine and bovine genetics; to allow the use of money in a non-sanctioned Russian bank account\nin the name of Genus Russia to pay Russian suppliers who continue to use sanctioned Russian bank accounts; and to remit any excess\nmoney in Genus Russia\u2019s non-sanctioned Russian bank account (regardless of whether it was received from a sanctioned or non-\nsanctioned Russian bank account) to other Genus Group company UK bank accounts.\nThe UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (\u2018OFSI\u2019) issued a general licence for trading in agricultural commodities in Russia\neffective on the 4 November 2022 which provides exemptions to the sanctions regime in connection with the export, production and\ntransport of agricultural commodities. This definition includes reproductive materials such as are supplied by Genus. Under this general",
        "licence, receipts from non-sanctioned customers received from and before 4 November 2022 from sanctioned banks no longer need to\nbe frozen and can be freely used. Also receipts from a sanctioned customer, if made through a non-sanctioned bank, no longer need to\nbe frozen and can be freely used. If any customer is or becomes sanctioned and pays through a sanctioned bank, these funds would still\nneed to be frozen even after 4 November 2022.\nUnder the requirements of IAS 7, where there is cash that is not available to be used by the rest of the Group this needs to be disclosed.\nAs at 30 June 2024, we had a cash balance of \u00a35.2m (30 June 2023: \u00a33.1m) in the Russian entities of which \u00a30.9m (30 June 2023: \u00a30.8m) is\nnot currently available to be used by the Group due to being received from sanctioned banks and held in a sanctioned bank.\nManagement has reviewed the operations and cash flow over a period of 18 months from 30 June 2024 to 31 December 2025, based\nupon the 2025 plans, to determine whether the Russian entities have sufficient non-sanctioned cash flow to enable them to continue\nday-to-day operations and to meet liabilities as they fall due. The analysis indicates they do have sufficient non-sanctioned cash flow\nto enable them to meet their day-to-day operational needs.\nCritical accounting judgement \u2013 exercise of control\nManagement has assessed whether the actions of the UK and Russian Governments have caused the Group to lose control of these\nRussian-based subsidiaries.**125\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nSTNEMETATS\nLAICNANIF\n4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED\nGenus PLC applied for a licence to the Department for International Trade (\u2018DIT\u2019) on 22 September 2022, to allow for UK-based\nemployees within the Genus group to provide accounting, business and management consulting services to the Russian-based",
        "subsidiaries, for the purpose of helping them carry out business operations in Russia, delivery of humanitarian assistance activity\nand for the production or distribution of food, provided that it is for the benefit of the civilian population.\nThe licence was authorised by the DIT and came into force on 11 January 2023. It authorises the following services:\n\u2022 The fullest possible range of accounting services, business and management consulting services, to include advisory, guidance\nand operational assistance services provided for business policy and strategy, and the overall planning, structuring, and control\nof the organisation.\n\u2022 The oversight that a parent company would typically provide to its subsidiaries in the areas of accounting, financial controls, tax,\ntreasury, finance and human resources, along with similar oversight in the areas of information technology, supply chain and other\ntypes of technology.\nThe licence expires on 11 January 2025 and, provided the facts and circumstances surrounding the issuance of the licence currently\nin place do not change materially we do not foresee any reasons why the licence could not be renewed.\nWe have concluded that we do have control over the Russian-based subsidiaries for the year ended 30 June 2024, as defined under\nIFRS 10 \u2018Consolidated financial statements\u2019, and we are still able to consolidate them despite short-term restrictions on extracting cash.\nWe have also assessed each of the asset balances for impairment. The material areas that could give rise to impairment are:\n\u2022 PIC Russia farm: \u00a32.5m (30 June 2023: \u00a32.4m) \u2013 the value of the farm is predicated on the future economic benefit of the animals\nthat are being reared there. We would need to assess if the property\u2019s open market price (less cost to sell) would support the\ncarrying value.\n\u2022 Trade receivables: \u00a34.4m (30 June 2023: \u00a32.7m) \u2013 the ongoing financial sanctions may affect our customers\u2019 ability to pay us for their",
        "goods. If it is determined that our customers are unlikely to repay these amounts, then they should be provided for.\n\u2022 IAS 41 valuation: \u00a32.7m (30 June 2023: \u00a33.9m) \u2013 the ongoing impacts of both the local economic outlook and our customers\u2019 ability\nto pay us could result in a reversal of the fair value of the Russian biological assets in the June valuation.\nManagement\u2019s impairment analysis indicates that, under the current business environment and based on the plans for the FY25\nno impairment is required as at 30 June 2024.\nManagement will continue to monitor the situation closely to see if any further changes require additional analysis that may result\nin a different conclusion.\nIn the event of changes in legislation, such as more restrictive sanctions imposed by the UK Government or actions taken by the Russian\nGovernment, we may determine that we do not exercise control, as defined under IFRS 10 \u2018Consolidated financial statements\u2019, over the\nassets and operations of the Russian entities and we would not be able to consolidate these companies into the Financial Statements.\nThe deconsolidation would mean that we would reclassify the Russian entities as investments and we would need to assess for\nimpairment. A charge of up to \u00a315.8m (2023: \u00a311.7m) may need to be recognised in the Income Statement, representing the total net\nassets of the two Russian entities. Dependent on the nature of the events leading to the decision to deconsolidate the entities, there\nmay be additional expenses incurred which we are unable to estimate at this time. In addition, revenues would not be consolidated into\nthe Financial Statements from the date of any deconsolidation. Revenues from the Russian entities were \u00a315.0m in the year ended\n30 June 2024 (2023: \u00a321.7m).\n5.

The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product or service\nto a customer.\nThe sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals, embryos and ancillary products\nRevenue from the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals, embryos and ancillary products is recognised when the\ncontrol of the goods has transferred to the customer or distributor. This is either when we ship to customers or on delivery, depending on\nthe terms of sale. Payment of the transaction price is due immediately, or within a short period of time, from the point the customer or\ndistributor controls the goods.\nRoyalties\nRoyalties are recognised when the performance obligation is met. We receive royalty payments from certain porcine customers based\non key performance variables, such as the number of pigs born per litter, the number of litters born per sow and the average slaughter\nweight of the animals born. This amount is confirmed directly to Genus by the customer. Payment of the transaction price is due",

Maintenance is provided as a distinct service to customers and is recognised over the period of the\nservice agreement. These revenues are presented in ancillary services in the following table.\nLicensing of IntelliGen technology\nRevenue from the licensing of IntelliGen technology is recognised at a point in time when the licence is granted. In determining the",

These additional royalties have been\ndetermined to be a usage-based royalty and are recognised as revenue at the point in time that the units are produced. These\nrevenues are presented in ancillary services in the following table.\nSlaughter of animals\nRevenue from the slaughter of animals is recognised when control of the goods has transferred to the slaughterhouse, which is generally\non the delivery of animals to the slaughterhouse. Payment of the transaction price is due immediately, or within a short period of time,\nfrom the point the slaughterhouse controls the goods.\nBovine partnership contracts\nPartnership contracts include the provision of multiple bovine products and services for a single price. The contract price is allocated to\nthe individual performance obligations based on their standalone selling prices.

For an item to be considered exceptional, it must initially meet at least one of\nthe following criteria:\n\u2022 it is a one-off material item;\n\u2022 it has been directly incurred as the result of either a corporate transaction, integration or other major restructuring programme;\n\u2022 it has been previously classified as an exceptional item, and as such consistent accounting treatment is being applied; or\n\u2022 it is unusual in nature, e.g. outside the normal course of business.\nIf an item meets at least one of the criteria, we then exercise judgement as to whether the item should be classified as exceptional.\nFor the tax and cash impact of exceptional items see notes 11 and 32, respectively.\n2024 2023\nOperating (expense)/credit \u00a3m \u00a3m\nLitigation (10.4) (4.5)\nCorporate transactions (7.4) (0.4)\nABS restructuring (6.0) 1.7\nR&D restructuring (0.7) \u2013\nOther (0.1) (0.3)\nNet exceptional items (24.6) (3.5)\nLitigation\nLitigation includes legal fees, settlement and related costs of \u00a310.4m (2023: \u00a34.5m) related to the actions between ABS Global, Inc. and\ncertain affiliates (\u2018ABS\u2019) and Inguran, LLC and certain affiliates (also known as STgenetics (\u2018ST\u2019)).\nMaterial litigation activities to 31 August 2024\nIn July 2014, ABS launched a legal action against ST in the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and initiated anti-trust",
        "proceedings, which ultimately enabled the launch of ABS\u2019s IntelliGen sexing technology in the US market (\u2018ABS I\u2019). In June 2017, ST filed\nproceedings against ABS in the same District Court, where ST alleged that ABS infringed seven patents and asserted trade secret and\nbreach of contract claims (\u2018ABS II\u2019). On 29 January 2020, ST filed a new US complaint against ABS in the same court (\u2018ABS III\u2019).\nOn 10 March 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u2018USPTO\u2019) issued patent 10,583,439 (the \u2018\u2019439 patent\u2019), and\nsubsequently ST asked the court for permission to file a supplemental complaint in ABS III asserting infringement of the \u2019439 patent. On\n15 April 2020, ST filed a new complaint (\u2018ABS IV\u2019), asserting the same claim of infringement of the \u2019439 patent alleged in its supplemental\ncomplaint and then moved to consolidate the ABS IV and ABS III litigation. The ABS I, ABS II, ABS III and ABS IV proceedings in the periods\nbefore the year ended 30 June 2023 are more fully described in the Notes to the Financial Statements in previous Annual Reports.\nOn 26 October 2020, ABS filed Inter Partes Reviews (\u2018IPR\u2019) against the \u2019439 patent with the USPTO. On 4 May 2021, the Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board (\u2018PTAB\u2019) instituted the \u2019439 patent IPR, and on 28 April 2022 PTAB issued its decision and declined to invalidate the claims\nof the \u2019439 patent. ABS has appealed the \u2019439 patent decision (the \u2018\u2019439 Appeal\u2019).\nOn 20 December 2021, the Wisconsin Federal Court reached a decision on certain ABS III and ABS IV motions. In relation to ABS III, the\ncourt dismissed ABS III litigation in its entirety and ST appealed certain aspects of the decision (the \u2018ABS III Appeal\u2019).\nOn 1 July 2022, the court reached a decision on the ABS II post-judgment motions as well as the pending motions in ABS IV. The court\nfollowed the jury decision in ABS II, and in relation to ABS IV the Court denied ABS\u2019s motion to dismiss the patent claims. Appeals were",
        "filed by ABS on the validity of the 8,206,987 patent (the \u2018987 Appeal\u2019), the 7,311,476 patent and the 7,611,309 patent (the \u2018ABS II Appeal\u2019)\nand ST appealed the award of the $5.3m in costs (the \u2018Fee Award Appeal\u2019).\nOn 27 December 2022, ABS and ST settled the 987 Appeal, the Fee Award Appeal and the Indian Patent Proceedings (see below).\nOn 5 July 2023, the Court of Appeals accepted ST\u2019s arguments in the ABS III Appeal in relation to claim preclusion for technology\ntransfer. The ABS III and ABS IV litigations were then consolidated, and the hearing moved to 31 March 2025.\nOn 19 October 2023, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned PTAB\u2019s decision in the 439 Appeal and found the\nindependent claims of the \u2018439 patent unpatentable. The Court of Appeals vacated PTAB\u2019s decision and remanded the decision back\nto the Board for further consideration.\nOn 11 January 2024, a settlement agreement relating to the \u2018439 Appeal, the ABS II Appeal, the ABS III/IV litigation and the New Zealand\nLitigation (see below) was agreed between the parties and each of these matters were discontinued. Other than the details given in\nnote 23, the terms of the settlement agreement are confidential. The CCI Appeal remains ongoing between the parties (see below).\nIndian Litigation: In September 2019, ST also filed parallel patent infringement proceedings against ABS in India, alleging infringement of\nthe Indian patent 240790 (\u2018\u2019790 patent\u2019). The \u2019790 patent is the equivalent of the US \u2018476 and \u2018309 patents and US patent 7,311,476\nasserted in ABS II (the \u2018Indian Patent Proceedings\u2019). In June 2021, ST appealed the decision of the Competition Commission of India\n(\u2018CCI\u2019) which had confirmed that ABS India had not breached the Indian Competition Act in relation to its participation in a sexed semen\ntender offered by the Uttar Pradesh Livestock Development Board (the \u2018CCI Appeal\u2019).**130\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements continued",

TAXATION AND DEFERRED TAXATION\nThis note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected\nfuture tax charges and sets out the tax assets and liabilities held across the Group, together with our view on whether or not we expect\nto be able to make use of them in the future.\nAccounting policies\nTax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. We recognise tax in the Income Statement, unless:\n\u2022 it relates to items we have recognised directly in equity, in which case we recognise it in equity; or\n\u2022 it arises as a fair value adjustment in a business combination.\nWe provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay (or recover), using the tax\nrates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments to tax payable in\nrespect of previous years.",
        "respect of previous years.\nDeferred tax is tax we expect to pay or recover due to differences between the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities in our\nFinancial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in calculating our taxable profit. We account for deferred tax using the\nbalance sheet liability method.\nWe generally recognise deferred tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets to the extent that we will\nprobably have taxable profits to utilise deductible temporary differences against. We do not recognise these assets and liabilities if\nthe temporary difference arises from:\n\u2022 our initial recognition of goodwill; or\n\u2022 our initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction (other than a business combination) that affects neither our\ntaxable profit nor our accounting profit.\nWe recognise deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences arising on our investments in subsidiaries, and interests in joint\nventures and associates, except where we can control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that it will not reverse\nin the foreseeable future.\nWe calculate deferred tax at the tax rates we expect to apply in the period when we settle the liability or realise the asset. We charge\nor credit deferred tax in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items we have charged or credited directly to equity, in which\ncase the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.**133\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nSTNEMETATS\nLAICNANIF\n11.

Tax is calculated using prevailing tax legislation, reliefs and existing interpretations and practice.\nThe statutory profit tax charge for the period, including share of income tax of equity-accounted investees of \u00a38.8m (2023: \u00a311.5m),\nrepresents an effective tax rate (\u2018ETR\u2019) of 78.6% (2023: 26.6%). The increase in the statutory ETR of 52 points results primarily from an\nincrease of 18.8% in the impact of fixed withholding taxes as a percentage of the lower statutory profit, an increase of 45.1% in non-\ndeductible expenses due to the disallowance for tax of adviser fees on increased corporate transaction activity, less the favourable",
        "(13.5)% impact of changes in judgements on deferred tax balances, movements in provisions and prior year credits.\nThe UK Finance (No. 2) Act 2023, which contains the UK\u2019s provisions addressing the implementation of BEPS Pillar Two, was substantively\nenacted on 20 June 2023. This legislation implements domestic and multinational top-up taxes, designed to achieve a global minimum\neffective tax rate of 15%, and is expected to first apply to Genus in the year ended 30 June 2025. The Group has performed an\nassessment of its potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. This assessment is based on the most recent information available\nregarding the financial performance of the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment, the Pillar Two effective tax rates\nin most of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates are above 15%. The Group therefore does not expect to have a material exposure\nto Pillar Two income taxes in future years. In the current year, the Group has applied the exception under the related IAS 12 amendment\nto recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar 2 income taxes.\nThe tax credit attributable to exceptional items is a credit of \u00a33.9m (2023: credit of \u00a30.9m).**134\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements continued\nFor the year ended 30 June 2024\n11.

GOODWILL\nAccounting policies\nWhen we acquire a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the goodwill arising is the excess of the acquisition cost, excluding transaction",
        "costs, over our interest in the net fair value of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Identifiable assets\ninclude intangible assets which could be sold separately, or which arise from legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are separable.\nWe state goodwill at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. We allocate goodwill to cash-generating units (\u2018CGUs\u2019), which are\nthe smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets\nor groups of assets. We do not amortise goodwill but we do test it annually for impairment.\nIAS 21 \u2018The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates\u2019 requires us to treat the following as assets and liabilities of the acquired entity,\nrather than of the acquiring entity:\n\u2022 goodwill arising on acquisition of a foreign operation; and\n\u2022 any fair value adjustments we make on acquisition to the carrying amounts of the acquiree\u2019s assets and liabilities.\nWe therefore express them in the foreign operation\u2019s functional currency and retranslate them at the balance sheet date.\nImpairment\nWe review the carrying amounts of our tangible and intangible assets at each balance sheet date, to determine whether there is any\nindication of impairment. If any indication exists, we estimate the asset\u2019s recoverable amount.\nFor goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, we estimate the recoverable amount at each balance\nsheet date. The recoverable amount is the greater of their fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, we discount\nthe estimated future cash flows to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate, which is derived from the Group\u2019s weighted average\ncost of capital (\u2018WACC\u2019). For some countries we add a premium to this rate, to reflect the risk attributable to that country. If the asset does",
        "not generate largely independent cash inflows, we determine the recoverable amount for the CGU that the asset belongs to.\nWe recognise an impairment loss in the Income Statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its\nrecoverable amount.\nWhen we recognise an impairment loss in respect of a CGU, we first allocate it to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated\nto the CGU, and then apply any remaining loss to reduce the carrying amount of the unit\u2019s other assets on a pro rata basis.\nThe aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each operating segment are as follows:\nGenus PIC Genus ABS Xelect Total\n\u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nCost\nBalance at 1 July 2022 78.3 32.7 \u2013 111.0\nEffect of movements in exchange rates (2.1) (1.1) \u2013 (3.2)\nBalance at 30 June 2023 76.2 31.6 \u2013 107.8\nBusiness combination (see note 41) \u2013 \u2013 4.0 4.0\nEffect of movements in exchange rates (0.7) (0.8) \u2013 (1.5)\nBalance at 30 June 2024 75.5 30.8 4.0 110.3\nImpairment losses\nBalance at 1 July 2022, 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2024 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nCarrying amounts\nAt 30 June 2024 75.5 30.8 4.0 110.3\nAt 30 June 2023 76.2 31.6 \u2013 107.8**138\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements continued\nFor the year ended 30 June 2024\n14. GOODWILL CONTINUED\nTo test impairment, we allocate goodwill to our CGUs, which are in line with our operating segments. These are the lowest level within\nthe Group at which we monitor goodwill for internal management purposes.\nWe test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. We determine the\nrecoverable amount of our CGUs by using value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations relate to discount rates,\nlong-term growth rates and short-term growth rates (which includes consideration of expected changes to selling prices, cost savings\nderived from the IntelliGen technologies, and changes in product mix).",
        "We have estimated the pre-tax discount rate using the Group\u2019s WACC. We risk-adjusted the discount rate for risks specific to each\nmarket, adding between nil and 21% (2023: nil and 27%) to the WACC as appropriate. The pre-tax discount rate of 12.2% (2023: 11.9%)\nwe applied to our cash flow projections equates to a post-tax rate of 9.8% (2023: 9.8%). Our estimates of changes in selling prices and\ndirect costs are based on past experience and our expectations of future changes in the market.\nThe annual impairment test is performed on 31 March (2023: 31 March). It is based on cash flows derived from our most recent financial\nand strategic plans approved by management, over the next five years, taking into account the impact of climate change. A growth\nrate of 2.5% (2023: 2.5%) has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond this period. Short-term profitability and growth rates are based\non past experience, current trading conditions (including the impact of inflation) and our expectations of future changes in the market.\nThere have been no additional indicators of impairment identified after this date for the Genus PIC and Xelect CGUs that would require\nthe impairment test to be reperformed. The impairment review has been updated for the ABS CGU on 30 June 2024 reflecting updated\nforecasts and currency impacts. The conclusion on 30 June 2024 did not differ from the conclusion at 31 March 2024.\nThe Genus PIC, Genus ABS and Xelect CGUs are deemed to be significant.

BIOLOGICAL ASSETS\nThe Group applies quantitative genetics and biotechnology to animal breeding. We use these techniques to identify and select\nanimals with the genes responsible for superior milk and meat, high health and performance traits. We sell breeding animals, semen\nand embryos to customers, who use them to produce offspring which yield greater production efficiency and milk and meat quality,\nfor the global dairy and meat supply chain. We recognise that accounting for biological assets is an area which includes key sources\nof estimation uncertainty. These are outlined in note 4 and sensitivities are provided below.\nAccounting policies\nBiological assets and inventories\nIn bovine, we use research and development to identify genetically superior bulls in a number of breeds, primarily the Holstein dairy\nbreed. Each selected bull has its performance measured against its peers, by using genomic evaluations and progeny testing of its\ndaughters\u2019 performance. We collect and freeze semen from the best bulls, to satisfy our customers\u2019 demand. Farmers use semen from\ndairy breeds to breed replacement milking stock. They use the semen we sell from beef breeds in either specialist beef breeding herds,",
        "for multiplying breeding bulls for use in natural service, or on dairy cows to produce animals to be reared for meat.\nOur research and development also enables us to produce and select our own genetically superior females, from which we will breed\nfuture bulls.\nWe hold our bovine biological assets for long-term internal use and classify them as non-current assets. We transfer bull semen to\ninventory at its fair value at the point of harvest, which becomes its deemed cost under IAS 2. We state our inventories at the lower\nof this deemed cost and net realisable value.\nSorting semen is a production process rather than a biological process. As a result, we transfer semen inventory into sexed semen\nproduction at its fair value at the point of harvest, less the cost to sell, and it becomes a component of the production process.\nWe carry sexed semen in finished goods at production cost.\nIn porcine, we maintain and develop a central breeding stock (the \u2018nucleus herd\u2019), to provide genetically superior animals. These\ngenetics help make farmers and food processors more profitable, by increasing their output of consistently high-quality products,\nwhich yield higher value. So we can capitalise on our intellectual property, we outsource the vast majority of our pig production to our\nglobal multiplier network. We also sell the offspring or semen we obtain from animals in the nucleus herd to customers, for use in\ncommercial farming.\nPig sales generally occur in one of two ways: \u2018upfront\u2019 and \u2018royalty\u2019. Under upfront sales, we receive the full fair value of the animal at the\npoint we transfer it to the customer. Under royalty sales, the pig is regarded as comprising two separately identifiable components: its\ncarcass and its genetic potential. We receive the initial consideration, which is approximately the animal\u2019s carcass value, at the point we",
        "transfer the pig to the customer. We retain our interest in the pig\u2019s genetic potential and receive royalties for the customer\u2019s use of this\ngenetic potential.\nThe breeding animal biological assets we own, and our retained interest in the biological assets we have sold under royalty contracts,\nare recognised and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. We recognise changes in fair value in the Income Statement,\nwithin operating profit for the period.\nWe classify the porcine biological assets we are using as breeding animals as non-current assets and carry them at fair value. The\nporcine biological assets we are holding for resale, which are the offspring of the breeding herd, are carried at fair value and classified\nas current assets.\nDetermination of fair values \u2013 biological assets\nIAS 41 \u2018Agriculture\u2019 requires us to show the carrying value of biological assets in the Group Balance Sheet. We determine this carrying\nvalue according to IAS 41\u2019s provisions and show the net valuation movement in the Income Statement. There are important differences\nin how we value our bovine and porcine assets, as explained below.\nBovine \u2013 we base the fair value of all bulls on the net cash flows we expect to receive from selling their semen, discounted at a current\nrisk-adjusted market-determined rate. The significant assumptions determining the fair values are the expected future demand for\nsemen, the estimated biological value and the marketable life of bulls. The biological value is the estimated value at the point of\nproduction. We adjust the fair value of the bovine herd and semen inventory where a third party earns a royalty from semen sales\nfrom a particular bull. Females are valued by reference to market prices and published independent genetic evaluations.\nPorcine \u2013 the fair value of porcine biological assets includes the animals we own entirely and our retained interest in the genetics",
        "of animals we have sold under royalty arrangements. The fair value of animals we own is calculated using the animals\u2019 average live\nweights, plus a premium where we believe that their genetics make them saleable. We base the live weight value and the genetic\npremium on recent transaction prices we have achieved. The significant assumptions in determining fair values are the breeding\nanimals\u2019 expected life, the percentage of production animals that are saleable as breeding animals and the expected sales prices.\nFor our retained interest in the genetics of animals sold under royalty contracts, we base the initial fair value on the fair values we\nachieved in recent direct sales of similar animals, less the amount we received upfront for the carcass element. We then remeasure the\nfair value of our retained interest at each reporting date. The significant assumption in determining the fair value of the retained interest\nis the animals\u2019 expected life.\nWe value the pigs in our pure line herds, which are the repository of our proprietary genetics, as a single unit of account. We do this\nusing a discounted cash flow model, applied to the herds\u2019 future outputs at current prices. The significant assumptions we make are\nthe number of future generations attributable to the current herds, the fair value prices we achieve on sales, the animals\u2019 expected\nuseful lifespan and productivity, and the risk-adjusted discount rate.**141\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nSTNEMETATS\nLAICNANIF\n16. BIOLOGICAL ASSETS CONTINUED\nNon-recognition of porcine multiplier contracts where the Group does not retain a contractual interest\nTo manage commercial risk, a very large part of our porcine business model involves selling pigs to farmers (\u2018multipliers\u2019) who produce\npiglets on farms we neither manage nor control. We have the option, but not the obligation, to buy the offspring at slaughter market",
        "value plus a premium. Because the offspring have superior genetics, we can then sell them to other farmers at a premium.\nWe do not recognise the right to purchase offspring on the Group Balance Sheet, as we enter into the contracts and continue to hold\nthem for the purpose of receiving non-financial items (the offspring), in accordance with our expected purchase requirements. This\nmeans the option is outside the scope of IFRS 9.

These risks include market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk\nand price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.\nWe seek to minimise the effects of these risks by hedging them using derivative financial instruments. Our use of financial derivatives\nis governed by policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk,\ncredit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. The Board of\nDirectors regularly reviews our compliance with policies and exposure limits. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments,\nincluding derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.\nKey financial risks and exposures are monitored through a monthly report to the Board of Directors, together with an annual Board",
        "review of corporate treasury matters.\nFinancial risk\nThe principal financial risks our activities expose us to are the risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and\ncommodity prices. We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and commodity\nprice risks, including:\n\u2022 forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of goods and purchase of supplies in\nforeign currencies;\n\u2022 interest rate swaps, to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates; and\n\u2022 forward commodity contracts, to hedge commodity price risk.**153\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nSTNEMETATS\nLAICNANIF\n26.

An equity instrument is any contract that\nprovides a residual interest in the Group\u2019s assets after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other\nfinancial assets. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.\nPut option arrangements over non-controlling interest\nThe potential cash payments related to put options issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary companies are accounted for\nas financial liabilities.\nThe amount that may become payable under the option on exercise is initially recognised at present value within financial liabilities,",
        "with a corresponding charge directly to equity. The charge to equity is recognised separately as written put options over non-controlling\ninterest, adjacent to non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries.\nSuch options are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, in order to accrete the liability up\nto the amount payable under the option at the date at which it first becomes exercisable. The charge arising is recorded as a financing\ncost. If the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognised, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\nDerivative financial instruments\nDerivatives are recognised initially at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to\ntheir fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement immediately, unless the\nderivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the Income Statement\ndepends on the nature of the hedge relationship.\nA derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised\nas a financial liability. Derivatives are not offset in the financial statements, unless the Group has both a legally enforceable right and\nintention to offset. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument\nis more than 12 months and it is not due to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or\ncurrent liabilities.\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet\ndate, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.",
        "The fair values of forward exchange contracts and forward commodity contracts are their quoted market prices at the balance sheet\ndate, which is the present value of the quoted forward price.\nHedging activities\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in respect of foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and commodity\nrisk in fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\nAt the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged\nitem, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the\ninception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting\nchanges in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationship meets\nall of the following hedge effectiveness requirements:\n\u2022 there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;\n\u2022 the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and\n\u2022 the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually\nhedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\nIf a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk management\nobjective for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship\n(i.e. rebalances the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again.\nThe Group designates the full change in the fair value of a forward contract (i.e. including the forward elements) as the hedging",
        "instrument for all of its hedging relationships involving forward contracts.\nThe Group designates only the intrinsic value of option contracts as a hedged item, i.e. excluding the time value of the option. The\nchanges in the fair value of the aligned time value of the option are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in\nthe cost of hedging reserve. If the hedged item is transaction-related, the time value is reclassified to the Income Statement when the\nhedged item affects the Income Statement. If the hedged item is time-period-related, then the amount accumulated in the cost of\nhedging reserve is reclassified to the Income Statement on a rational basis, applying straight-line amortisation. Those reclassified\namounts are recognised in the Income Statement in the same line as the hedged item. If the hedged item is a non-financial item, then\nthe amount accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve is removed directly from equity and included in the initial carrying amount of the\nrecognised non-financial item. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve\nwill not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to the Income Statement.**154\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements continued\nFor the year ended 30 June 2024\n26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED\nCash flow hedges\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives and other qualifying hedging instruments that are designated and\nqualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging\nreserve, and limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to\nthe ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is included in the \u2018other gains and losses\u2019 line item.",
        "Amounts previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to the Income Statement in\nthe periods when the hedged item affects the Income Statement, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the\nhedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously\nrecognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are removed from equity and included in the initial measurement\nof the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. This transfer does not affect Other Comprehensive Income. Furthermore, if\nthe Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that\namount is immediately reclassified to the Income Statement.\nThe Group discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria\n(after rebalancing, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. The\ndiscontinuation is accounted for prospectively. Any gain or loss recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the\ncash flow hedging reserve at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to the Income Statement when the forecast transaction\noccurs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve is\nreclassified immediately to the Income Statement.\nUnder interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts\ncalculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the\nfair value of issued fixed-rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable-rate debt held. The fair value of interest rate",
        "swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the\ncredit risk inherent in the contract. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.\nIf the critical terms of the interest rate swap contracts and their corresponding hedged items are the same, the Group performs a\nqualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the interest rate swap contracts and the value of the\ncorresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite directions, in response to movements in the underlying interest rates.\nThe main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships is the effect of the counterparty and the Group\u2019s own credit risk\non the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the change\nin interest rates. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships.\nNet investment hedges\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the foreign currency\nforward contracts relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the\nforeign currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income\nStatement, and is included in the \u2018other gains and losses\u2019 line item.\nGains and losses on the hedging instrument accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to the Income\nStatement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.\nWe only apply net investment hedge accounting in the Group Financial Statements.\nOther gains and losses\nIncluded with other gains and losses is a \u00a32.1m loss on the mark-to-market valuation (\u2018MTM\u2019) in relation to \u00a360m of SONIA interest rate",
        "swaps executed in April 2023. Whilst the interest rate swaps are a perfect commercial hedge of a similar amount of our GBP borrowings\nfor at least a three-year period, as the executing banks have a written option at the three-year point to unilaterally terminate the swaps\nat no cost, the transaction does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly the MTM loss on the valuation of these swaps\nas at 30 June 2024 is recognised in the Group Income Statement.

        "Categories of financial instruments\nWe have categorised financial instruments held at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs\nto the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 13. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair value fall\nwithin different levels of the hierarchy, we base the category level on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement of the instrument in its entirety.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED\nInterest rate sensitivity analysis\nWe have determined the sensitivity analyses below, based on the Group\u2019s exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and\nnon-derivative instruments, at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, we prepared the analysis assuming the liability\noutstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 1.0 percentage point increase or decrease is used\nwhen reporting interest rate risk internally to key management and is our assessment of a significant change in interest rates.\nIf interest rates had been 1.0 percentage point higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group\u2019s profit would have\ndecreased or increased by \u00a31.3m (2023: decrease/increase by \u00a31.6m). This impact is smaller than would otherwise be the case, due to\nour fixed-rate hedging.\nInterest rate swap contracts\nUnder interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts,\ncalculated on agreed notional principal amounts. These contracts enable us to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the\ncash flow exposures on the variable-rate debt we hold. We determine the fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date by\ndiscounting the future cash flows, using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.

The corresponding floating rate on the interest rate swaps is three months. We settle\nthe difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.\nInterest rate swap contracts that exchange floating-rate interest amounts for fixed-rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow\nhedges, to reduce our cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest\npayments on the loan occur simultaneously and we recognise the amount deferred in equity in the Income Statement, over the period\nthat the floating rate interest payments on debt affect the Income Statement.\nCommodity hedges\nThe Group hedges both feed and slaughter exposures using Chicago Mercantile Exchange lean hog, corn and soybean meal\ncommodity futures contracts.\nAverage price Notional principal amount Fair value\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCommodity hedge US$ US$ \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nOpen commodity contracts as at June\nLean hog 0.84 0.97 14.9 8.5 0.9 0.6\nCorn 4.71 5.68 (9.4) (6.4) (0.4) (0.6)\nSoybean meal 353.10 402.00 (3.4) (4.6) (0.1) (0.1)\n2.1 (2.5) 0.4 (0.1)\nNet investment hedges",

On 30 June 2024, USD45m of our fixed rate cover expired and replacement cover was put in place at a\nfixed rate of 4.576%. Approximately 65% of total facility borrowings are covered by these interest rate swaps as at 30 June 2024 with an\naverage maturity of 19 months.\n28. OBLIGATIONS UNDER LEASES\nA lease is a commitment to make a payment in the future, primarily in relation to property, plant and machinery and motor vehicles.\nAccounting policies\nIn accordance with IFRS 16, we recognise as an expense any payments made in respect of short-term leases (those with a term of less\nthan 12 months) and leases for low-value items, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.\nFor all other leases we recognise a liability at the date at which the leased asset is made available for use, and a corresponding\nright-of-use asset is recognised and depreciated over the term of the lease (see note 17).\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the future lease payments, excluding any payments relating to non-lease\ncomponents. Future lease payments include fixed payments, in-substance fixed payments, and variable lease payments that are\nbased on an index or a rate, less any lease incentives receivable. Lease liabilities also take into account amounts payable under residual\nvalue guarantees and payments to exercise options, to the extent that it is reasonably certain that such payments will be made.",
        "The payments are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease or, where that cannot be measured, at an incremental borrowing rate.\nWe remeasure the lease liability (and make a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever:\n\u2022 The lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of the exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease\nliability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.\n\u2022 The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual\nvalue, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate\n(unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used).\n\u2022 A lease contract is modified, and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability\nis remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.\nThe Group did not make any such adjustments during the periods presented.**161\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nSTNEMETATS\nLAICNANIF\n28.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes, covering many of its employees. The\nprincipal funds are the Milk Pension Fund (\u2018MPF\u2019) and the Dalgety Pension Fund (\u2018DPF\u2019) in the UK, which are defined benefit schemes.\nThe assets of these funds are held separately from the Group\u2019s assets, and are administered by trustees and managed professionally.\nAccounting policies\nDefined contribution pension schemes\nA number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. We charge contributions to the Income Statement\nas they become payable under the scheme rules. We show differences between the contributions payable and the amount we have\npaid as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet. The schemes\u2019 assets are held separately from the Group\u2019s assets.\nDefined benefit pension schemes\nThe Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for some of its employees. These schemes are closed to new members and to\nfurther accrual. We calculate our net obligation separately for each scheme, by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees\nhave earned, in return for their service to date. We discount that benefit to determine its present value and deduct the fair value of the\nplan\u2019s assets (at bid price). The liability discount rate we use is the market yield at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate\nbonds, with terms to maturity approximating our pension liabilities. Qualified actuaries perform the calculations, using the projected\nunit method.",
        "unit method.\nWe recognise actuarial gains and losses in equity in the period in which they occur, through the Group Statement of Comprehensive\nIncome. Actuarial gains and losses include the difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets and experience\ngains and losses on scheme liabilities.\nGenus and the other participating employers are jointly and severally liable for the MPF\u2019s obligations. We account for our section of the\nscheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, and provide for any amounts we believe we will have to pay under our joint\nand several liability. The joint and several liability also means we have a contingent liability for the scheme\u2019s obligations that we have\nnot accounted for.**162\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements continued\nFor the year ended 30 June 2024\n29. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED\nUnder the joint and several liability, we initially recognise any changes in our share of orphan assets and liabilities in the Income\nStatement. After this initial recognition, any actuarial gains and losses on the orphan assets and liabilities are recognised directly\nin equity through the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, in the period in which they occur.\nDuring the year, the DPF defined benefit pension scheme purchased annuities in order to hedge longevity risk for pensioners within the\nscheme. As permitted by IAS 19, the Group has opted to recognise the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the cost\nof the policy as an actuarial loss in Other Comprehensive Income.\nWe measure the fair value of our qualifying insurance policy assets to be the deemed present value of the related obligation.\nRetirement benefit obligations\nThe financial positions of the defined benefit schemes, as recorded in accordance with IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, are aggregated for\ndisclosure purposes. The liability/(asset) split by principal scheme is set out below.\n2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m",

The trustee board of each\npension fund consists of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company. The boards of\nthe pension funds are required by law to act in the best interest of the plan participants and are responsible for setting certain policies,\nsuch as investment and contribution policies, and for the governance of the fund.\nThe defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as greater than expected longevity of members, lower\nthan expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the plans\u2019 liabilities or reduce the value\nof their assets.\nUK pensions are regulated by The Pensions Regulator, a non-departmental public body established under the Pensions Act 2004\nand sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions, operating within a legal regulatory framework set by the UK Parliament.\nThe Pensions Regulator has statutory objectives set out in legislation, which include promoting and improving understanding\nof the good administration of work-based pensions, protecting member benefits and regulating occupational defined benefit\nand contribution schemes.

        "from The Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and valued at least every three years.\nSeparate valuations are required for each scheme. Within 15 months of each valuation date, the plan trustees and the Group must\nagree any contributions required to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time, on a suitably prudent measure.\nFunding plans are individually agreed with the respective trustees for each of the Group\u2019s defined benefit pension schemes, taking into\naccount local regulatory requirements.\nIn June 2023 the High Court ruled, in the case of Virgin Media vs NTL Pension Trustees II Limited, that certain historical adjustments to\ndefined benefit schemes may be invalid. We are aware and will continue to monitor the issue, but note the ruling is subject to appeal\nand at this stage, until the legal position is clarified, we make no allowance for the impact of the judgment.\nThe Milk Pension Fund (\u2018MPF\u2019)\nThe MPF was previously operated by the Milk Marketing Board and was also open to staff working for Milk Marque Ltd (the principal\nemployer, now known as Community Foods Group Limited), National Milk Records plc, First Milk Ltd, hauliers associated to First Milk Ltd,\nDairy Farmers of Britain Ltd (which went into receivership in June 2009) and Milk Link Ltd. Genus Breeding Limited is currently the principal\nemployer.\nWe have accounted for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, which together represent\napproximately 86% of the MPF (2023: 86%). Although the MPF is managed on a sectionalised basis, it is a \u2018last man standing\u2019 scheme,\nwhich means that all participating employers are jointly and severally liable for all of the fund\u2019s liabilities.

Interest on plan liabilities\namounted to \u00a3nil (2023: \u00a3nil).\nThe principal assumptions used to calculate the plan liabilities were that the discount rate would be 5.15% (2023: 5.25%) and that the\nlong-term rate of medical expense inflation would be 6.90% (2023: 7.05%).\nAggregated position of defined benefit schemes\n2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m\nPresent value of funded obligations (includes Genus\u2019s 86% share of MPF (2023: 86%)) 722.8 746.8\nPresent value of unfunded obligations 7.4 7.4\nTotal present value of obligations 730.2 754.2\nFair value of plan assets (includes Genus\u2019s 86% share of MPF (2023: 86%)) (760.0) (787.6)\nRestricted recognition of asset (MPF and DPF) 36.4 40.3\nRecognised liability for defined benefit obligations 6.6 6.9\nEach of the defined benefit schemes manages risks through a variety of methods and strategies, including equity protection, to limit\nthe downside risk of falls in equity markets, as well as inflation and interest rate hedging. By funding its defined benefits schemes, the\nGroup is exposed to the risk that the cost of meeting its obligations is higher than anticipated. This could occur for several reasons,\nfor example:\n\u2022 Investment returns on the schemes\u2019 assets may be lower than anticipated, especially if falls in asset values are not matched by similar",
        "falls in the value of the schemes\u2019 liabilities.\n\u2022 The level of price inflation may be higher than that assumed, resulting in higher payments from the schemes.\n\u2022 Scheme members may live longer than assumed, for example due to advances in healthcare. Members may also exercise (or not exercise)\noptions in a way that leads to increases in the schemes\u2019 liabilities, for example through early retirement or commutation of pension\nfor cash.\n\u2022 Legislative changes could also lead to an increase in the schemes\u2019 liabilities.\nAggregated position of defined benefit schemes\nThe fair value of the total plan assets at the end of the reporting period for each category is as follows:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 2024 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nEquities \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 16.3 \u2013 16.3\nDiversified growth funds \u2013 102.0 \u2013 102.0 \u2013 46.1 \u2013 46.1\nLiability-driven investments \u2013 108.7 \u2013 108.7 \u2013 108.4 \u2013 108.4\nGilts and corporate bonds \u2013 34.1 \u2013 34.1 \u2013 73.0 \u2013 73.0\nCash 1.4 1.6 \u2013 3.0 1.6 3.6 \u2013 5.2\nProperty 1.6 \u2013 20.8 22.4 2.4 \u2013 22.8 25.3\nDirect lending \u2013 1.1 26.3 27.4 \u2013 2.9 34.3 37.2\nBulk annuity policy \u2013 \u2013 462.4 462.4 \u2013 \u2013 476.1 476.1\n3.0 247.5 509.5 760.0 4.0 250.3 533.2 787.6\nNote:\nLevel 1: valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.\nLevel 2: valued using techniques based on information that can be obtained from observable market data.\nLevel 3: valued using techniques incorporating information other than observable market data.\nMovement in the liability for defined benefit obligations\n2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m\nLiability for defined benefit obligations at the start of the year 754.2 866.0\nBenefits paid by the plans (57.7) (56.3)\nCurrent service costs and interest 38.0 32.6\nActuarial gains recognised on fund liabilities arising from changes in demographic assumptions (3.8) (15.2)\nActuarial losses/(gains) recognised on fund liabilities arising from changes in financial assumptions 1.9 (104.0)",

The sensitivity analysis below\nshows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease\nin the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at 30 June 2024. We have included additional sensitivity analysis, which\nexcludes the value of our defined benefit obligations backed by purchased annuities, as the asset value is the deemed present value\nof obligations, with no movement to the overall scheme deficits.\nDiscount rate Rate of inflation Life expectancy\nDecrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase\nby 0.5% by 0.5% by 0.5% by 0.5% by 1 year by 1 year\n\u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nIncrease/(decrease) in present value of defined obligation 42.6 (41.4) (27.0) 31.1 (27.6) 27.6\nExcluding purchased annuity obligations\nincrease/(decrease) in present value of defined obligation 15.6 (15.2) (9.9) 11.4 (10.1) 10.1\nThe sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation, as it is unlikely that changes\nin assumptions would occur in isolation from one another.\nThe sensitivities assume the funds\u2019 assets remain unchanged. However, in practice changes in interest rates and inflation will also affect\nthe value of the funds\u2019 assets. The funds\u2019 investment strategy is to hold matching assets with values that move in line with the liabilities\nof the fund, to protect against changes in interest rates and inflation.\nThis sensitivity analysis has been prepared using the same method adopted when adjusting results of the latest funding valuation to the\nbalance sheet date. This is the same approach as adopted in previous periods.\nThe history of experience adjustment is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022 2021 2020\n\u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nPresent value of the defined benefit obligation 730.2 754.2 866.0 1,106.6 1,169.3",

CONTINGENCIES AND BANK GUARANTEES\nContingent liabilities are potential future cash outflows, where the likelihood of payments is considered more than remote but is not\nconsidered probable or cannot be measured reliably. Assessing the amount of liabilities that are not probable is highly judgemental.\nThe retirement benefit obligations referred to in note 29 include obligations relating to the MPF defined benefit scheme. Genus, together\nwith other participating employers, is joint and severally liable for the scheme\u2019s obligations. Genus has accounted for its section and its",
        "share of any orphan assets and liabilities, collectively representing approximately 86% (2023: 86%) of the MPF. As a result of the joint and\nseveral liability, Genus has a contingent liability for the scheme\u2019s obligations that it has not accounted for. The total deficit of the MPF\nfrom the most recent triennial valuation can be found in note 29.\nThe Group makes a provision for amounts to the extent that an outflow of economic benefit is probable and can be reliably estimated.\nHowever, there are specific claims identified in the litigation where the Group considers the outcome of the claim is not probable and will\nnot result in the outflow of economic benefit.\nThe Group\u2019s future tax charge and effective tax rate could be affected by factors such as countries reforming their tax legislation to\nimplement the OECD\u2019s BEPS recommendations and by European Commission initiatives including state aid investigations. Further\ninformation can be found in note 11.\nAt 30 June 2024, the Group had entered into bank guarantees totalling \u00a30.6m (2023: \u00a312.6m).**172\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements continued\nFor the year ended 30 June 2024\n36.

All amounts were settled in cash.\nThese related-party transactions were made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm\u2019s length transactions.\n41. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nOn 5 December 2023, the Group exercised an option to acquire the remaining 61% of the issued share capital of Xelect Limited (\u2018Xelect\u2019).\nPrior to this, the Group owned 39% of the issued share capital. Xelect is a leading provider of specialist genetics and breeding\nmanagement services to the aquaculture industry. Xelect was acquired to establish a window into the Aqua sector and a foundational\nplatform upon which the Group can build an entry into the aqua germplasm space.\nThe amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are as set out in the table below.\n\u00a3m\nOther intangible assets 2.0\nProperty, plant and equipment 0.3\nRight-of-use assets 0.4\nInventories 0.1",

ACCOUNTING INFORMATION AND POLICIES\nBasis of preparation\nThe Parent Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 \u2018Reduced\nDisclosure Framework\u2019 (\u2018FRS 101\u2019) and the Companies Act 2006 (the \u2018Act\u2019). FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for a\n\u2018qualifying entity\u2019 as defined in the standard, which addresses the financial reporting requirements and disclosure exemptions in the\nindividual financial statements of qualifying entities that otherwise apply the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements\nof the Companies Act 2006. The Group Financial Statements have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial\nReporting Standards as issued by the IASB.\nThe Company Financial Statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities and in accordance with the Act. The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going\nconcern basis, as set out in note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements of Genus plc. The accounting policies set out below and\nstated in the relevant notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Financial Statements.",
        "The Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101 in relation to share-based payments, business\ncombinations, financial instruments, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow\nstatement, standards issued not yet effective, impairment of assets and related-party transactions. Where required, equivalent\ndisclosures are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Genus plc.\nAs permitted by section 408 of the Act, the Company has not presented its own Income Statement in this Annual Report.\nThe functional currency of the Company is Sterling.\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nPreparing company financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date\nand the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised\nin the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods,\nif the revision affects both current and future periods.\nImpairment of investment held in subsidiaries (see note C5)\nDetermining whether the carrying value of the investment held in subsidiaries is impaired requires us to consider specific impairment\nindicators and estimate the value in use of the cash-generating units (\u2018CGU\u2019). This estimation involves projecting future cash flows from\nthe CGU, selecting an appropriate discount rate, and determining growth rates to calculate the present value.\nSignificant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole",
        "This section sets out our significant accounting policies that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy\nis generally applicable to a specific note to the Financial Statements, the policy has been described in that note.\nOther income and deferred income\nThe Company has entered into a strategic collaboration with Beijing Capital Agribusiness (\u2018BCA\u2019) under which BCA will establish and\nfund a collaboration-specific entity (\u2018BCA Future Bio-Tech\u2019) which will use Genus\u2019s intellectual property and know-how to pursue the\nPRRS-resistance regulatory and development work in China. Genus will receive consideration after meeting certain milestones in the\ndevelopment programme.\nEach milestone is considered to be either a separate performance obligation, or a set of separate performance obligations, under this\nagreement and milestones are unbundled in the contractual arrangement as if they are distinct from one another.\nWe assess each separate performance obligation relating to the milestone payments, and upon completion of those performance\nobligations recognise the fair value of amounts earned in other income. Some performance obligations, such as the transfer of\nknow-how, are recognised at a point in time whereas others, such as the provision of technical services, are recognised over time.\nWe recognise any received but unearned consideration as deferred income.\nWe will apply the same accounting policy to any other comparable agreements.\nPensions\nA number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. We charge contributions to profit and loss as they\nbecome payable under the schemes\u2019 rules. We show differences between the contributions payable and the amounts actually paid\nas either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet. The schemes\u2019 assets are held separately from those of the Company.\nCertain former employees of the Company are members of one of the Group\u2019s defined benefit pension schemes, details of which are",
        "given in note 29 to the Group Financial Statements. The schemes are all multi-employer defined benefit schemes, whose assets and\nliabilities are held independently from the Group but within their sponsored Group company.\nTaxation\nWe provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay or recover, using the tax rates\nand the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is tax we expect to pay or recover due to the differences between the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities in our\nFinancial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in calculating out taxable profit. We account for deferred tax using the\nbalance sheet liability method.**182\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nNotes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued\nFor the year ended 30 June 2024\nC1. ACCOUNTING INFORMATION AND POLICIES CONTINUED\nForeign currencies\nWe record transactions in foreign currencies at the rate ruling at the transaction date. We retranslate monetary assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies at the prevailing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the\nIncome Statement.\nOwn shares\nThe Company has adopted FRS 101, which requires us to recognise the assets and liabilities associated with the Company\u2019s investment\nin its own shares in the Company\u2019s Financial Statements, where there is de facto control of the assets and liabilities.\nThe Company\u2019s own shares held by a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust remain deducted from shareholders\u2019 funds until\nthey vest unconditionally with employees.\nEmployee share schemes\nThe Company\u2019s Executive Directors and Chief Operating Officers receive part of their remuneration in the form of share awards,\nwhich vest upon meeting performance criteria over a three-year period.",
        "We measure the cost of these awards by reference to the shares\u2019 fair value at the award date. At the end of each financial reporting\nperiod, we estimate the extent to which the performance criteria will be met at the end of three years and record an appropriate charge\nin the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding credit to profit and loss reserves. Changes in estimates of the number of\nshares vesting may result in charges or credits to the profit and loss account in subsequent periods.\nShare-based payments\nWe have implemented the generally accepted accounting principle for accounting for share-based payments with subsidiary\nundertakings under FRS 101, whereby the Company has granted rights to its shares to employees of its subsidiary undertakings under\nan equity-settled arrangement, and the subsidiaries have not reimbursed the Company for these rights. Under this arrangement, the\nCompany treats the share-based payment recognised in the subsidiary\u2019s financial statements as a cost of investment in the subsidiary\nand credits equity with an equal amount.\nDerivative financial instruments and hedging\nOur activities expose us primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nWe use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk. We also use forward foreign currency contracts, implemented through a medium-\nterm US Dollar cross-currency borrowing and related interest rate swap, to hedge exposure to translation risk associated with US Dollar\nnet assets of subsidiaries. Forward foreign currency contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in the Parent Company Financial\nStatements, as the hedged item is not in its Balance Sheet.\nOur use of financial derivative instruments is governed by the Group\u2019s policies, which are approved by the Board of Directors. The notes\nto the Group Financial Statements include information about the Group\u2019s financial risks and their management, and its use of financial",
        "instruments and their impact on the Group\u2019s risk profile, performance and financial condition.\nThe fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap\nat the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.\nThe fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, which is the present value of the\nquoted forward price.\nCash flow hedges\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives and other qualifying hedging instruments that are designated and\nqualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging\nreserve, and limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating\nto the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement, and is included in the \u2018other gains and losses\u2019 line item.\nAmounts previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to the Income Statement\nin the periods when the hedged item affects the Income Statement, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when\nthe hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses\npreviously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are removed from equity and included in the initial\nmeasurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. This transfer does not affect Other Comprehensive Income.\nFurthermore, if the Company expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve will not be recovered\nin the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to the Income Statement.",
        "The Company discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying\ncriteria (after rebalancing, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\nThe discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. Any gain or loss recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated\nin the cash flow hedging reserve at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to the Income Statement when the forecast\ntransaction occurs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in the cash flow hedging\nreserve is reclassified immediately to the Income Statement.\nUnder interest rate swap contracts, the Company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts\ncalculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Company to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on\nthe fair value of issued fixed-rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable-rate debt held. The fair value of interest\nrate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the\ncredit risk inherent in the contract. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.**183\nGENUS PLC / Annual Report 2024\nSTNEMETATS\nLAICNANIF\nC1. ACCOUNTING INFORMATION AND POLICIES CONTINUED\nAs the critical terms of the interest rate swap contracts and their corresponding hedged items are the same, the Company performs\na qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the interest rate swap contracts and the value of the\ncorresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite directions, in response to movements in the underlying interest rates.",
        "The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships is the effect of the counterparty and the Company\u2019s own credit\nrisk on the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the\nchange in interest rates. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships.\nC2.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nAccounting policies\nPatents, licences and software are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation. The amortisation period is determined by\nreference to expected useful life, which is reviewed at least annually. Amortisation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line\nbasis over the estimated useful life. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic\nbenefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated\nas changes in accounting estimates.\nSee note 15 for useful economic life.

The rates of annual depreciation on tangible fixed assets are as follows:\n\u2022 Leasehold improvements period of lease\n\u2022 Leased buildings period of lease\n\u2022 Equipment 3 to 10 years\nWe review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may\nnot be recoverable.\nRight-of-use assets\nRight-of-use assets are measured initially at cost based on the value of the associated lease liability, adjusted for any payments made\nbefore inception, initial direct costs and an estimate of the dismantling, removal and restoration costs required in the terms of the lease.\nSubsequent to initial recognition, we record an interest charge in respect of the lease liability.

        "The Company considers the relationship between its invested capital and the carrying value of its investments, among other factors,\nwhen reviewing for indicators of impairment. As at 30 June 2024, the net investment in five of the Company\u2019s subsidiary undertakings\nexceeded the Company\u2019s share of the net assets. Each of these subsidiaries are denominated in Latin American currencies, all of which\nhave seen significant weakening against Sterling during the year ended 30 June 2024. For each of these undertakings, the recoverable\nvalue has been estimated using the Board-approved forecasts. There were no significant indicators of impairment for the Company\u2019s\nother subsidiary undertakings.\nThe key assumptions for the value in use calculation are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and expected trading performance.\nManagement estimates discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the\nGroup. The pre-tax discount rates are derived from the Group\u2019s post-tax weighted average cost of capital (\u2018WACC\u2019), which has been\ncalculated using the capital asset pricing model, the inputs of which include a country risk-free rate, equity risk premium, Group size\npremium and a risk adjustment (beta). This equates to a pre-tax discount rate of 12.2% (2023: 11.2%). Cash flows beyond the five-year\nperiod are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate of 2.5% (2023: 2.5%).\nDuring the year, \u00a312.8m was provided against the investment held in ABS Argentina (\u00a31.8m) and ABS Brazil (\u00a311.0m) to reflect a reduction\nin the net assets of those companies and expected future trading performance.\nPrincipal subsidiary undertakings\nThe Company\u2019s principal subsidiaries and their main activities are given in note 37 to the Group Financial Statements.\nSensitivity to changes in assumptions\nManagement has performed the following sensitivity analysis:\n\u2022 changing the key assumptions, with other variables held constant;",
        "\u2022 simultaneously changing the key assumptions.\nManagement has concluded that no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions would lead to a material impairment in\nthe carrying amounts of investments in subsidiaries, except for Brazil.\nThere are reasonably possible changes to key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of the ABS Brazil investment to exceed\nits recoverable amount based on our value in use calculations.\nManagement has identified the following assumptions as key sources of estimation uncertainty within the ABS Brazil value in use\ncalculation (see note C1).\n2024 2023 Sensitivity\nWeighted average risk-adjusted discount rate 12.5% 14.3% Increase of 1% in the discount rate would decrease the\nrecoverable amount by \u00a30.6m\nWeighted average short-term growth rate (CAGR) 10.4% 11.8% Decrease of 1% in the CAGR would decrease the recoverable\namount by \u00a31.0m\nLong-term growth rate 2.5% 2.5% Decrease of 1% in the long-term growth rate would decrease\nthe recoverable amount by \u00a30.4m\nC6.

DEFERRED TAXATION\nAccounting policies\nWe recognise deferred taxation in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date,\nwhere transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the\nbalance sheet date.\nWe only recognise deferred taxation assets if we consider it more likely than not that we will have suitable profits from which we can deduct\nthe future reversal of the underlying timing differences. Timing differences are differences arising between the Company\u2019s taxable profits\nand its results as stated in the Financial Statements, and which are capable of reversing in one or more subsequent periods.\nWe only recognise deferred taxation in respect of the future remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that,\nat the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.\nWe measure deferred taxation on a non-discounted basis, at the tax rates we expect to apply in the periods in which we expect the\ntiming differences to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nAt the balance sheet date, the Company had a deferred tax asset of \u00a316.3m (2023: \u00a36.8m).\nThe movements in deferred taxation are as follows:\n2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m\nAt the start of the year 6.8 3.8\nRecognised in the Income Statement 9.2 4.3\nRecognised in equity 0.3 (1.3)\nAt the end of the year 16.3 6.8\nThe amounts provided are as follows:\n2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m\nShare-based payment expense 5.4 1.0",

We have recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of this benefit, as we expect these losses to be offset against\nfuture profits of the UK tax group in the near term.\nThe increase in the deferred tax asset relating to tax losses of \u00a38.7m is the result of transferring \u00a36.8m of carry-forward tax losses within\nthe UK subsidiaries to the Company following elections made in the computations submitted during the year.

This additional exercise was requested in",
        "part to replace the \u00a317m reduction in headroom following the departure of Bankinter from the facility from 23 August 2024, as this bank\ndid not participate in the second one-year extension request because of changes in their corporate strategy to concentrate on\nbusinesses with a clear connection to their Spanish homeland. Following the departure of Bankinter and the exercise of the accordion\nincrease, \u00a3208.2m and USD 161m RCFs are available to the Group to 24 August 2025. A new multi-year facility will be negotiated and put\nin place during the year to 30 June 2025.\nAs part of its interest rate hedging strategy, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge variable interest rates. During\nthe year to 30 June 2024, bank loan and overdrafts included borrowings of USD 85m fixed at 3.90%, borrowings of \u00a360m fixed at 3.45%,\nborrowings of EUR 12.5m fixed at 0.37%, and borrowings of USD 13.9m, swapped via a cross-currency swap into EUR 12.5m, fixed at 0.36%,\nexcluding applicable bank margins. On 30 June 2024, USD 45m of our fixed rate cover expired and replacement cover was put in place\nat a fixed rate of 4.576%.

OBLIGATIONS UNDER LEASES\nA lease is a commitment to make a payment in the future, primarily in relation to property, plant and machinery and motor vehicles.\nAccounting policies\nIn accordance with IFRS 16, we recognise as an expense any payments made in respect of short-term leases (those with a term of less",
        "than 12 months) and for low-value items on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.\nFor all other leases we recognise a liability at the date at which the leased asset is made available for use, and a corresponding\nright-of-use asset is recognised and depreciated over the term of the lease (see note C4).\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the future lease payments, excluding any payments relating to non-lease\ncomponents. Future lease payments include fixed payments, in-substance fixed payments, and variable lease payments that are\nbased on an index or a rate, less any lease incentives receivable. Lease liabilities also take into account amounts payable under\nresidual value guarantees and payments to exercise options, to the extent that it is reasonably certain that such payments will\nbe made. The payments are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease or, where that cannot be measured, at an incremental\nborrowing rate.\nWe remeasure the lease liability (and make a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever:\n\u2022 The lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of the exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease\nliability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.\n\u2022 The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual\nvalue, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate\n(unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used).\n\u2022 A lease contract is modified, and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability\nis remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.\nThe Company did not make any such adjustments during the periods presented.**189",
