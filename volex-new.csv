The accordion feature provides further capacity for potential future acquisitions. This facility comprises a $165m\nrevolving credit facility and a $75m term loan. The borrowing is secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets of\ncertain Group companies. As at the year end, these totalled $251.0m (2023: $226.5m).\nThe terms of the facility require the Group to perform quarterly financial covenant calculations with respect to leverage\n(adjusted total debt to adjusted rolling 12-month EBITDA) and interest cover (adjusted rolling 12-month EBITDA to adjusted\nrolling 12-month interest). A breach of these covenants could result in cancellation of the facility. The Group was compliant\nwith these covenants during the period and remains compliant in the period subsequent to the period end.\nDuring the period, $0.3m of professional fees were incurred due to the exercise of $40m of the accordion, raising the\ncommitted facility from $200m to $240m. All $0.3m of this was paid to the syndicate. During the prior period, $0.5m was\ncapitalised in relation to the exercising of the first of two one-year options.
