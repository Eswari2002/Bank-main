This allowed us to establish a clear plan about what we needed to do during the\nfirst 100 days of ownership. We have acquired an excellent business with some significant\nnew customers. The response of customers and our new colleagues has been extremely\npositive.\nThe current focus is on enhancing processes within Murat Ticaret to ensure they are\nconsistent with the high standards that we have across our entire organisation. We are also\nengaging with our Off-Highway customers to look at how we can best serve them in other\ngeographic markets \u2013 particularly in North America. Overall, we are very pleased with the",
        "business we have acquired and the progress we are making around integration.\nHow has the approach to integration developed?\nWe\u2019ve now acquired 12 businesses in the last six years. When we made our first three\nacquisitions back in 2018, we ran them on a standalone basis, concentrating on aligning\naround key control areas. This worked well given that we manage our operations in a\ndecentralised way, with experienced local managers able to make timely decisions.\nAs our Group has developed, we have increased the scope of our integration process,\nhaving experienced and recognised the clear benefits from a common operating model.\nWe\u2019ve had some significant successes through cross-selling. It has also been great to bring\ntogether sales, operations and engineering specialists from our different entities so that\nthey can work together to deliver innovation and operational improvements.\nLord\nRothschild\nExecutive\nChairman\nJohn\nMolloy\nChief\nOperating\nOfficer\nstock code: VLX\nVolex\nplc\nAnnual\nReport\nand\nAccounts\nfor\nthe\nyear\nended\n2024\n34**What characteristics do you look for in acquisitions?\nOne of the reasons we have been able to acquire some very successful businesses for\nattractive valuations is that we keep an open mind to acquisitions and we consider a\nbroad range of targets. We have bought businesses in markets that we understand well,\nwhere we have a good insight into why the commercial proposition is compelling for the\ncustomer.\nIn terms of what an ideal acquisition would look like, it would bring great customers and\nscale in a specialist manufacturing area. Location is important because we want to make\nsure we have an experienced team available to support the integration activities. With so\nmuch growth happening around the Group, this is a key consideration.\nHow do you determine where to invest?\nWe are a customer-centric organisation, so a lot of our decisions about investment start\nwith the customer. We have very close relationships with many of our customers, giving",
        "us an insight into their future requirements. This shapes our investment strategy both in\nterms of where we look to grow our production footprint as well as enhancing capabilities.\nThe other key element is enhancing efficiency. Our continuous improvement culture\ndrives us towards identifying ways to optimise our production and improve our delivery.\nThis allows us to continue to deliver excellent value to our customers, which allows us to\nwin more opportunities.\nWhat are the localisation trends that are impacting the market?\nThere has been a significant shift in the way our customers approach procurement. With\nall of the disruption experienced in supply chains in the last couple of years, there is a trend\ntowards reducing complexity and eliminating risk. Often, this involves choosing a supplier\nwho can manufacture closer to home. This is a major opportunity for Volex, given our\nglobal footprint and our capabilities in attractive markets like Mexico and India.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that moving the complex products that we manufacture is not simple.\nOur engineering capabilities and experience give our customers confidence that we\ncan deliver a seamless process when they look to transfer production from alternative\nproviders. This is also why it is so important that we have capacity available now. Once\ncustomers have moved production, they will have little appetite to move it again for some\ntime. As a result, we are bringing on incremental capacity to support the current wave of\ndemand to localise production.\nWhat have been some of the major projects the team has\ndelivered this year?\nIt\u2019s been a really busy year. There has been a lot of focus on expanding some of our key\nsites so we can support our customers\u2019 growth requirements. This gives us a platform to\ndeliver the incremental revenue we require to hit our five-year plan.\nWe also worked closely with one of our major customers to deliver a complex and critical",
        "assembly for one of their flagship electric vehicle projects. This required close collaboration\nbetween our production specialists and the customer\u2019s engineering team. Our ability to\nsupport challenging technical requirements through the manufacturing process is a real\ndifferentiator and contributed to the successful delivery of this programme.\n35\nwww.volex.com\nBusiness overview Strategic Governance Financials**Operational review\ncontinued\nWhat do you see as the major growth opportunities for the\nremainder of the five-year plan?\nOne of the things that is so exciting right now is that we can see excellent opportunities in\nall parts of our business. We have deliberately aligned ourselves to markets with significant\nstructural growth drivers, which gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver growth.\nLocalisation is a significant trend in manufacturing and we see this as particularly relevant\nfor the complex, mission-critical assemblies that are an essential part of our customers\u2019\nadvanced technology products. For our higher volume customers, the efficiencies and\nproduction enhancements we have secured are helping us win new business based on\ncompetitive pricing and exceptional quality. We are also very excited by what we can\ndeliver in Off-Highway, where we have great capabilities and long-standing relationships\nwith some very important customers.\nHow have your capabilities and locations developed in\nrecent years?\nWe are fortunate to operate in markets with strong structural growth drivers, as well as\nserving customers who are growing strongly as they deploy innovative technology. As a\nresult, we need to invest in expanding our available manufacturing footprint and ensure\nthat we can support the increasing demand.\nWe have had a particular focus on being able to deliver high-quality manufacturing in\ncompetitive locations, which can help customers reduce supply chain complexity or",
        "reliance on a particular region. We listen carefully to what our customers need so we can\nimprove our offerings and have the right combination of specialist services to support their\ndeveloping product sets.\nWhat\u2019s the most important factor in delivering success?\nDelivering advanced manufacturing requires a combination of people, processes and\ntechnology; but it\u2019s the people that drive the business. We have an amazing team of\nhard-working and talented individuals, who are able to collaborate and support the\nrequirements of our customers. Given the importance of people to our business, we put\na lot of time and effort into talent management, personal development and succession\nplanning.\nWhat are the key challenges you are dealing with at Volex?\nCustomers want to partner with us because we provide excellent customer service,\ncompetitive pricing and exceptional quality. Delivering this requires a continuous focus on\noperational excellence throughout the organisation. This is particularly relevant given the\ngrowth that we are experiencing, both as we onboard new customer projects and support\nthe transfer of production between locations.\nWith so much happening across our organisation, robust project management skills\nand good communication is critical. We have well-established teams who work together\neffectively to allow us to hit key milestones and to respond to changing customer\nrequirements.

As part of this process, the Committee will take into consideration the Executive Director\u2019s\nduty to mitigate their loss.\nIf employment is terminated by the Company, the departing Executive Director may have a legal entitlement (under statute\nor otherwise) to certain payments, which would be met.

        "provided for below) and the individual must seek independent legal advice.\nIn certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors\nincluding (but not limited to) settlement, confidentiality, restrictive covenants and/or consultancy arrangements.

The aim is for overall levels\nof remuneration to be at or around market median through base salary and bonus that is set around the\nlower quartile, but with long-term incentives set above median.\nThe Committee reviewed salaries during the year and agreed that salaries for Lord Rothschild and for Jon\nBoaden should be increased in line with the UK workforce average of 6%.

Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates based on the weighted average cost of capital for a\nmarket participant and the risks specific to the business unit. Forecast revenue is based upon forecast customer sales\ninitiatives, new product development, marketing strategy and industry growth rates. Management has considered the\nimpact of climate change on goodwill impairment, including the increased costs of delivering on our ESG strategy and\nthe increased opportunity for green products, such as Electric Vehicles.

However, Volex has retained late payment and credit risk. Where there is recourse,\nthe Group continues to recognise the transferred assets in their entirety in its balance sheet. The amount repayable\nunder the factoring agreement is presented as secured borrowing. The Group considers that the held-to-collect business\nmodel remains appropriate for these receivables and, hence, continues measuring them at amortised cost. Where there is\nnon-recourse, the receivable is de-recognised upon receipt of the cash.\nThe Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.\nOther receivables comprises recoverable sales taxes, supplier deposits and other operating debtors.\nOne (2023: one) of the Group\u2019s customers individually accounts for more than 10% of total Group revenue. The largest\ncustomer operates in the Electric Vehicles sector and accounts for 11.4% (2023: 15.8%) of total Group revenue. Other than\nthis customer, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of\ncounterparties and customers. At 31 March 2024, the largest customer represented 12% of the net trade receivables\n(2023: 17%).\nThe average credit period taken on sales of goods is 72 days (2023: 73 days). An allowance has been made for estimated\nirrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods. This allowance has been determined by reference to the expected credit loss,\nwhich includes consideration of past default experience, an analysis of the counterparty\u2019s current financial position, the\ncurrent economic environment and potential losses.",

The borrowing is secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets of\ncertain Group companies. As at the year end, these totalled $251.0m (2023: $226.5m).\nThe terms of the facility require the Group to perform quarterly financial covenant calculations with respect to leverage\n(adjusted total debt to adjusted rolling 12-month EBITDA) and interest cover (adjusted rolling 12-month EBITDA to adjusted\nrolling 12-month interest). A breach of these covenants could result in cancellation of the facility. The Group was compliant\nwith these covenants during the period and remains compliant in the period subsequent to the period end.\nDuring the period, $0.3m of professional fees were incurred due to the exercise of $40m of the accordion, raising the\ncommitted facility from $200m to $240m.

Deferred tax continued\nAt the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of $84.0m (2023: $89.2m) available for offset against future\nprofits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of $27.4m (2023: $28.8m) of these losses.\nIncluded in the unrecognised tax losses are losses of $11.4m (2023: $17.3m) that cannot be carried forward indefinitely. Of this\namount, $7.3m (2023: $7.5m) expires during the next five accounting periods.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it is\nprobable that there are sufficient taxable profits to allow all or part to be recovered. In assessing the probability of recovery,\nthe five-year cash flow forecast that has been used for goodwill impairment testing was used as a basis for determining the\nprobable taxable profits arising in each relevant jurisdiction.

        "in making this assessment.\nAt the reporting date, a deferred tax liability of $1.7m (2023: $1.6m) has been recognised relating to the unremitted earnings\nof overseas subsidiaries. The temporary differences represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries\nwhere remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding\ntaxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate. No deferred tax liability is recognised on\ntemporary differences of $88.2m (2023: $64.2m) on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the\nreversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rate expected to apply in the period in which the asset is realised\nor the liability is settled.\n22.

These preference and ordinary shares\nwere subsequently acquired by the company and the preference shares were redeemed by Cash Box. The acquisition by\nthe company of the ordinary shares in Cash Box held by the broker resulted in the company securing over 90% of the equity\nshare capital of Cash Box. The company was therefore able to rely on Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, which provides\nrelief from the requirements under Section 610 of the Companies Act 2006 to create a share premium account. Therefore,\nno share premium was recorded in relation to the Placing Shares.\nThe premium over the nominal value of the Placing Shares was recognised in retained earnings.

A valuation of the Scheme is\ncarried out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met. As part of the\nprocess, the Company must agree with the Trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to meet the Statutory\nFunding Objective.

In the event that the valuation reveals a larger deficit than expected, the Company\nmay be required to increase contributions above those set out in the existing Schedule of Contributions. Conversely, if the\nposition is better than expected, it is possible that contributions may be reduced.\nIn accordance with the Schedule of Contributions dated September 2020 the Company has agreed to pay contributions of\n\u00a30.8m p.a.

        "At the period end, the Scheme was in surplus. The Group has an unconditional right to any surplus arising in the Scheme,\nhence that surplus has been recognised in full. The Scheme does not have an asset ceiling.\nThe Scheme is managed by a Trustee Company, the Board of which is appointed in part by the Company and in part from\nelections by members of the Scheme. The Trustees have responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering\nbenefit payments and investing the Scheme\u2019s assets. The Trustee delegates some of these functions to their professional\nadvisers where appropriate.\nThe Scheme exposes the Company to a number of risks:\n\u2022 Investment risk. The Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values\nand while these assets are expected to provide the real returns over the long-term, the short-term volatility can cause\nadditional funding to be required if the deficit increases.\n\u2022 Interest rate risk. The Scheme\u2019s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount\nthe liabilities. As the Scheme holds assets such as equities, the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the\nsame way.\n\u2022 Inflation risk. A significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation. Although the Scheme\u2019s\nassets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, movements over the short term could\nlead to deficits emerging.\n\u2022 Mortality risk.

The\nfacility comprises a $165 million revolving credit facility (\u2018RCF\u2019) and a $75 million term loan. As at 31 March 2024, the term\nloans of $75m were fully drawn and $68.6m (2023: $16.5m) was also utilised under the revolving credit facility. The Group also\noperates a cashpool facility, which is denominated in a variety of currencies. As at 31 March 2024, there was a $1.0m overdraft\n(2023: $1.7m). The average combined utilisation of the cashpool during the period was $0.3m (2023: $2.5m).\nIncluded in note 19 is a description of undrawn facilities as at the reporting date.\nThe terms of the RCF require the Group to perform quarterly financial covenant calculations with respect to leverage\n(adjusted total debt to adjusted rolling 12-month EBITDA) and interest cover (adjusted rolling 12-month EBITDA to adjusted\nrolling 12-month interest). Breach of these covenants could result in cancellation of the facility.

The Group is exposed to floating rate interest on its RCF\nborrowings at a margin of 2.1% (2023: 2.1%) above SOFR (2023: SOFR).

The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their\ntranslation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes both external\nloans and loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the\ncurrency of the lender or the borrower.

Financial instruments continued\nCopper commodity price risk\nCopper price volatility is the single largest commodity price exposure facing the Group. Many of the Group\u2019s products, in\nparticular power cords used to manufacture the Group\u2019s power products, are manufactured from components that contain\nsignificant amounts of copper. Where possible, the Group will pass on copper price movements to its customers. In order\nto mitigate the remaining volatility associated with copper, the Group has entered into arrangements with its key suppliers\nto purchase copper. Coupled with these purchases, the Group has entered into a number of contracts with financial\ninstitutions, which are linked to the average copper price as published by the London Metal Exchange (\u2018LME\u2019). These\ncontracts have been deemed cash flow hedges of forecast future copper purchases. At the reporting date, the open copper\ncontracts are as follows:\n2024 2023\nContracted Contracted\nCopper cash flow hedges volume Fair value volume Fair value\nContracted copper price (MT) $\u2019m (MT) $\u2019m\n$7,000\u2013$7,500 \u2013 \u2013 125 0.1\n$7,500\u2013$8,000 315 0.1 40 \u2013\n$8,000\u2013$8,500 19 \u2013 392 \u2013\n$8,500\u2013$9,000 55 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n$9,000\u2013$9,500 \u2013 \u2013 100 \u2013\n389 0.1 657 0.1",

Financial instruments continued\nCredit risk\nThe Group\u2019s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables. Credit risk refers to the risk\nthat a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.",
        "Bank and cash balances comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three\nmonths or less. The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value. The credit risk on these assets is\nlimited because the counterparties are predominantly financial institutions with investment-grade credit ratings assigned\nby international credit rating agencies.\nThe Group\u2019s credit risk is, therefore, primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The Group\u2019s customers are predominantly\nlarge blue-chip OEMs, contract equipment manufacturers and distributors. The Group regularly reviews the\ncreditworthiness of significant customers and credit references are sought for major new customers where relevant. The\nBoard recognises that credit risk is a feature of all businesses, especially international businesses. However, it believes that\nall reasonable steps to mitigate any loss are taken.\nThe net amount of trade receivables reflects the maximum credit exposure to the Group. No other guarantees or security\nhave been given. For further information on the credit risk associated with trade and other receivables, see note 18.\n32. Contingent liabilities\nAs a global Group, subsidiary companies, in the normal course of business, engage in significant levels of cross-border\ntrading. The customs, duties and sales tax regulations associated with these transactions are complex and often subject to\ninterpretation. While the Group places considerable emphasis on compliance with such regulations, including appropriate\nuse of external legal advisers, full compliance with all customs, duty and sales, tax regulations cannot be guaranteed.\nThrough the normal course of business, the Group provides manufacturing warranties to its customers and assurances\nthat its products meet the required safety and testing standards. When the Group is notified that there is a fault with one",
        "of its products, the Group will provide a rigorous review of the defective product and its associated manufacturing process\nand, if found at fault and contractually liable, will provide for costs associated with recall and repair as well as rectify the\nmanufacturing process or seek recompense from its supplier. The Group holds a provision to cover potential costs of recall\nor warranty claims for products which are in the field but where a specific issue has not been reported.\nWhere the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other Group companies,\nthe Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability\nuntil such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. At the\nperiod end, there were no outstanding guarantees (2023: none).\n33. Related party transactions\nTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation\nand are not disclosed in this section of the note.\nThe Group\u2019s other related party transactions were the remuneration of key management personnel (refer to note 9). Details\nof Directors\u2019 remuneration for the period are provided in the Remuneration Committee Report on page 115. As explained\nin note 16, during the period, the Group paid $2.3m for an additional 8.3% of equity in Kepler SignalTek Ltd, increasing\nthe shareholding to 35.7%. During the period, $0.9m of preference shares were repaid (2023: $0.4m). The Group accrued\nfinancial income of $nil on the preference shares (2023: $0.2m), with $0.5m cash received (2023: nil). The balance due from\nthe associate as at the period end date was $0.3m (2023: $1.7m).\nThe Group also has a 43% interest in Volex-Jem Co. Ltd. The Group did not transact with the entity during the current or\nprior periods. The balance due to the associate as at the period end date was $0.1m (2023: $0.1m).",
        "34. Events after the balance sheet date\nIn June 2024 the Group completed a refinancing of its banking facilities, with an eight-bank club. An enlarged $600 million\nfacility replaced the Group\u2019s existing $300 million multicurrency revolving credit facility. The new facility has an initial\nfour-year term, with an extension option for one additional year. It comprises a $400 million revolving credit facility and\nan additional $200 million uncommitted accordion. The new facility is unsecured, with improved interest margins and an\nimproved net debt to underlying EBITDA covenant.\n179\nwww.volex.com\nBusiness overview Strategic Governance Financials**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\ncontinued\nFor the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2024 (52 weeks ended 2 April 2023)\n35. Business combinations\nMurat Ticaret Kablo A.\u015e.\nOn 31 August 2023, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Murat Ticaret Kablo A.\u015e. (\u2018Murat\nTicaret\u2019) a leading manufacturer of complex wire harnesses, headquartered in T\u00fcrkiye. Murat Ticaret has a number of\nsubsidiaries which have minority interests. The acquisition expands the Group presence in the off-highway sector with\noperations on three continents and nine manufacturing sites.\nThe purchase has been accounted for as a business combination. Details of the purchase consideration, the net assets\nacquired and goodwill are as follows:\nProvisional fair value of consideration transferred $\u2019m\nInitial consideration 150.2\nDeferred consideration 6.0\nContingent consideration 39.8\nTotal purchase consideration 196.0\nInitial consideration includes initial cash of $150.1m and an estimated working capital adjustment payable of $0.1m. Deferred\nconsideration is the fair value of a \u20ac7.5m payment due in 2029.\nThe contingent consideration is dependent upon certain EBITDA targets being met post-acquisition over two one-year\nmeasurement periods. The fair value above has been based on the probable outcome of each based upon the information",
        "available at 31 March 2024. The maximum undiscounted contingent consideration payment across the two periods is\n$43.1m (\u20ac40m).\nIn addition to these payments, a further $2.0m is payable upon certain service conditions being met over a two year period.\nIn accordance with IFRS 3, this is accounted for as remuneration rather than deferred or contingent considerations due to\nthe ongoing service conditions. An expense of $0.7m has been recorded in adjusting items related to this post-acquisition\nperformance.\nAn exercise has been conducted to assess the provisional fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This exercise\nidentified customer relationships and order backlog intangible assets. Property, plant and equipment were uplifted\nfollowing an external valuation. The provisional fair value amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed are set out in the table below:\nProvisional\nFair Value\n$\u2019m\nIdentifiable intangible assets 101.9\nProperty, plant and equipment 26.3\nRight-of-use asset 6.6\nInventories 47.4\nTrade receivables 39.7\nCash 15.8\nOther debtors and creditors (9.3)\nTrade payables (27.5)\nProvisions (2.4)\nRetirement benefit obligations (4.8)\nLoans (4.1)\nLease liabilities (6.6)\nDeferred taxes (26.1)\nTotal identifiable assets 156.9\nLess non-controlling interest (0.2)\nGoodwill 39.3\nConsideration 196.0\nstock code: VLX\nVolex\nplc\nAnnual\nReport\nand\nAccounts\nfor\nthe\nyear\nended\n2024\n180**35. Business combinations continued\nThe fair value adjustments are provisional and will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date. Any resulting\nchanges in the fair values will have an impact on the acquisition accounting and will result in a reallocation between assets\nand goodwill and a possible adjustment to the amortisation charge shown in the income statement. The non-controlling\ninterest has been initially measured at fair value.",
        "The provisional goodwill balance recognised above includes certain intangible assets that cannot be separately identified\nand measured due to their nature. This includes control over the acquired business, the skills and experience of the\nassembled workforce and the anticipated synergies arising on integration. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to\nbe deductible for income tax purposes.\nIn FY2024, the Murat Ticaret businesses contributed $132.4m to Group revenue, $20.6m to adjusted operating profit and\n$10.5m to operating profit. Associated acquisition-related costs of $3.7m, acquisition-related remuneration of $0.7m and\nintangible asset amortisation of $7.4m have all been expensed as adjusting items in the period.\nIf these entities had been acquired at the beginning of the year, they would have contributed revenues of $216.7m and\noperating profit of $24.6m to the results of the Group.\nNet cash outflows in respect of acquisitions comprises:\nNet cash outflow on acquisitions $\u2019m\nCash consideration\n\u2013 Murat Ticaret 150.1\nTotal cash consideration 150.1\nLess: cash and cash equivalents acquired\n\u2013 Murat Ticaret (15.8)\nNet cash outflow for Murat Ticaret 134.3\nPayment of deferred consideration\n\u2013 DE-KA 2.2\nTotal cash outflow 136.5\n181\nwww.volex.com\nBusiness overview Strategic Governance Financials**Company Statement of Financial Position\nAs at 31 March 2024 (2 April 2023)\nCompany\n2024 2023\nNotes \u00a3\u2019m \u00a3\u2019m\nNon-current assets\nOther intangible assets 4 0.2 0.1\nRight-of-use assets \u2013 0.1\nInvestments 5 310.6 191.8\nDerivative financial instruments 1.2 0.7\nRetirement benefit asset 11 0.3 \u2013\nDeferred tax asset 10 8.0 10.2\n320.3 202.9\nCurrent assets\nInventories 6 3.1 4.5\nTrade receivables 7 11.4 14.8\nOther receivables 7 45.9 11.0\nDerivative financial instruments 1.2 0.7\nCash and bank balances 1.1 0.1\n62.7 31.1\nTotal assets 383.0 234.0\nCurrent liabilities\nBorrowings \u2013 1.7\nTrade payables 9 0.2 0.3\nOther payables 9 50.5 24.0\nLease liability \u2013 0.1",

Underlying\nEBITDA is defined as underlying operating profit adjusted for depreciation and amortisation. The Group uses underlying\noperating profit and underlying EBITDA to present meaningful year-on-year comparisons. The reconciliation between\noperating profit and underlying operating profit and underlying EBITDA is presented in note 7.\nUnderlying basic earnings per share and underlying diluted earnings per share\nUnderlying basic earnings per share is defined by the profit attributable to the owners of the parent company, excluding\nadjusting items, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. Underlying diluted earnings\nper share adjusts the basic earnings per share by the effect of dilutive potential share options as at the period end date.\nBoth metrics are reconciled to statutory measures in note 11.\nOrganic growth\nAs the group has undertaken twelve acquisitions in the past six years, management uses organic revenue growth so that\nmeaningful year-on-year comparisons can be made.\nOrganic revenue growth is calculated using constant exchange rates by taking the total reported revenue (excluding the\nimpact of acquisitions and disposals) divided by the preceding financial year\u2019s revenue at the current year\u2019s exchange rates.\nComplex",
